<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>A mobile application leveraging AI to allow users to take photos of their meals and receive personalized, actionable insights about their diet based on their specific health goals, dietary restrictions, and past eating patterns. Think of it as a food journal that interprets itself for you.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Transforms the tedious task of manual food logging into a seamless, visual experience. Provides instant, personalized feedback and suggestions based on <em>how</em> and <em>what</em> the user actually eats, making healthy eating habits easier to understand and maintain without relying on calorie counting or complex nutrient tracking.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<p>Individuals who want to eat healthier, manage weight, track dietary restrictions (allergies, intolerances, specific diets like keto or vegan), or simply gain awareness about their eating habits, but are put off by traditional, manual food logging methods.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day)</h2>
<p>A simple web page or mobile app screen with:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Photo Upload:</strong> A prominent button allowing users to upload a single food photo from their device.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated Processing:</strong> Upon upload, a brief animated loader or text like "Analyzing your delicious mealâ€¦" appears.</li>
<li><strong>Placeholder Result:</strong> After a short, fixed delay (e.g., 5 seconds), the loader is replaced by a pre-written, generic placeholder message. This message clearly states that this is an early prototype and real analysis is coming soon, e.g., "Thanks for uploading! Future versions will provide personalized insights like estimated macros, potential allergens, and tips tailored to your goals right here. Stay tuned!" This MVP focuses purely on the core interaction loop: user takes a photo -&gt; app responds (even if with fake data for now), validating the core user flow and desirability without needing complex backend AI yet.</li>
