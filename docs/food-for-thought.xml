<p><strong>ShelfScan AI</strong> is a lightweight, edge-computing SaaS solution enabling small and medium-sized retail stores to autonomously monitor product shelves for stock levels and compliance. Utilizing low-cost, off-the-shelf camera hardware (like a Raspberry Pi camera or an old smartphone) directly at the point of sale or on the shelf, the system performs real-time visual analysis locally. Only actionable insights and aggregated data are transmitted to a central cloud dashboard, ensuring speed, data privacy, and minimal bandwidth consumption, while providing store owners with immediate alerts on critical inventory or display issues.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>"Eliminate lost sales due to empty shelves and wasted staff time on manual checks. Gain immediate, actionable insights into shelf health and planogram compliance, reducing operational costs and maximizing product availability, all through an affordable, privacy-preserving, and easy-to-deploy system."</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>Small to medium-sized retail businesses across various sectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local grocery stores & convenience stores:</strong> Struggling with high SKU counts and rapid stock turnover.</li>
<li><strong>Pharmacies:</strong> Ensuring critical medications are always available and correctly displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Boutiques & Specialty Stores:</strong> Maintaining pristine visual merchandising and identifying fast-moving items.</li>
<li><strong>Any independent retailer</strong> who finds enterprise-level shelf monitoring solutions prohibitively expensive or overly complex, but recognizes the significant impact of out-of-stocks or misplaced items on sales and customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>The objective for Day 1 is to prove the core loop: Edge Detection -&gt; Cloud Alert.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Edge Component (Python Script on a local machine/Raspberry Pi):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use OpenCV (or Pillow) to capture an image from a connected webcam/camera.</li>
<li>Define a static "shelf region" (ROI - Region of Interest) within the captured image.</li>
<li><strong>"Empty Shelf" Detection (Simple Heuristic):</strong> Implement a basic image analysis function. This could be comparing the average pixel brightness/color within the ROI against a pre-recorded "empty shelf" baseline image, or simply detecting significant deviation in pixel distribution from a "full shelf" state. The goal is to detect a noticeable change indicating a potential absence, not specific SKU recognition.</li>
<li>If "empty" status is detected, construct a minimal JSON payload: <code>{"device_id": "my_test_shelf", "status": "empty", "timestamp": "ISO_8601_STRING"}</code>.</li>
<li>Send this JSON via HTTP POST to a pre-defined webhook URL (e.g., a free <code>webhook.site</code> URL, a simple serverless function, or a Flask endpoint running locally/on a public IP).</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>SaaS "Dashboard" (Day 1 Version):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For proving the concept, the "dashboard" for Day 1 can be as simple as viewing the incoming payloads directly on <code>webhook.site</code>, or a local Python script that prints received JSON data to the console/logs them to a file. The success is in seeing the automated alert data flow from edge to cloud.</li></ul></li>
