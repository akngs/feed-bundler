            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a world where news isn't a static broadcast, but a living, evolving understanding built and refined by a community. This year's idea blends the power of AI with the collaborative spirit of a wiki and the critical mission of journalism.</p>
<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>ContextFlow is a platform where traditional news articles are ingested, and AI assists in breaking down their core claims. These claims then become points of discussion and verification for a community, allowing users to add context, corrections, or supporting evidence, much like entries on Wikipedia. The goal is to evolve a more accurate, nuanced, and collaboratively vetted narrative around ongoing events.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>For readers, ContextFlow offers a dynamic, transparent source of information, mitigating biases and improving understanding through community input. It's about empowering collective intelligence to build trust in what we read. For contributors, it provides a structured mechanism to share expertise, rectify misinformation, and enrich public discourse.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discerning News Consumers:</strong> Individuals seeking more context, accuracy, and diverse perspectives beyond mainstream media. </li>
<li><strong>Subject Matter Experts & Academics:</strong> Professionals eager to contribute their knowledge for public benefit and engage in peer-driven fact-checking.</li>
<li><strong>Citizen Journalists & Fact-Checkers:</strong> Groups and individuals dedicated to verifying information and combating disinformation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>To launch the core concept in a single day, focus on proving the user interaction loop, <em>simulating</em> AI and persistence where necessary:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Input Form:</strong> A simple web page with a single text input field where a user can paste a news article URL or raw text.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulated AI Processing:</strong> When the user clicks "Analyze," <em>do not</em> make a real AI API call. Instead, display a <em>pre-defined, hardcoded example</em> of an article's breakdown. This example should consist of: </p>
<ul>
<li>The original article text (or a summary). </li>
<li>3-5 key "claims" or "statements" extracted from that <em>fixed example article</em>.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic Collaborative Input:</strong> For each of the pre-defined claims, provide a simple text area labelled "Add Context/Correction." Include a "Submit" button. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephemeral Display:</strong> When a user submits text, simply append it below the respective claim on the same page. This data does not need to be saved to a database for the MVP; storing it temporarily in browser local storage or letting it disappear on refresh is acceptable. The focus is on demonstrating the <em>interface</em> for collective annotation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP creates a tangible demo of the core collaborative process without getting bogged down by real AI integration, user accounts, or complex data persistence. The true value is in demonstrating the idea of breaking down news into verifiable claims and enabling community input.</p>]]></content:encoded>
