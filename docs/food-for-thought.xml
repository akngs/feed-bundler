<p>Indie developers, today's profound idea centers on leveraging AI within the confines of plain text to champion feminist principles in communication. The digital landscape, despite its vastness, often re-circulates linguistic biases. This is an opportunity to build a tool that promotes equity, one word at a time, without complexity.</p>
<h2 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h2>
<p>EthosText AI is an intelligent linguistic analysis service that takes plain text input and meticulously scrutinizes it for subtle gender biases, patriarchal assumptions, and non-inclusive language patterns. It's not about censorship, but illumination. The system then provides actionable, plain-text suggestions or annotations to empower the writer to craft more equitable and thoughtful communication.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>EthosText AI empowers writers to proactively align their plain text communications with principles of inclusivity, fairness, and consciousness. It provides a non-judgmental, AI-driven second opinion that helps authors identify and rectify unconscious biases, fostering a more equitable narrative in everything from articles to technical documentation, all while maintaining the simplicity and interoperability of plain text formats.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content Creators & Journalists:</strong> Individuals and small teams striving for responsible and inclusive reporting or storytelling.</li>
<li><strong>Academics & Researchers:</strong> Scholars aiming for bias-free language in their publications and proposals.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Profit Organizations & Activists:</strong> Groups committed to social justice, ensuring their advocacy materials are consistent with their values.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Writers & Developers:</strong> Teams building documentation that reflects modern diversity and inclusion standards.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals:</strong> Anyone who wishes to improve their writing for inclusivity and identify their own linguistic biases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>Build a basic command-line tool or a simple web interface (a single HTML page with a text area and a button). This MVP will:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accept Plain Text Input:</strong> Via standard input (CLI) or a text area (web).</li>
<li><strong>Apply Rule-Based Bias Detection:</strong> Implement a small, focused set of rules/keywords to flag common gendered terms or phrases. For instance:<ul>
<li>Identify words like "mankind," "manpower," "forefathers" and suggest gender-neutral alternatives ("humankind," "workforce," "ancestors").</li>
<li>Flag generic</li></ul></li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>
