<p><strong>Brief Description of the Idea:</strong></p>
<p>PhishFighter AI is a web-based tool designed to transform the critical yet often tedious task of identifying phishing and malicious emails into an engaging, gamified learning experience. Users submit suspicious email content, and an AI-powered system provides instant analysis, highlights dangerous elements, and educates them on how to spot real threats. This makes cybersecurity training interactive and directly applicable, empowering individuals to become their own first line of defense.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition:</strong></p>
<p>We turn the passive and often intimidating subject of email cybersecurity into an active, enjoyable game. By providing immediate, intelligent feedback on real-world email examples, PhishFighter AI significantly enhances an individual's ability to recognize and avoid a wide range of email-based cyber threats, building crucial digital resilience through practical, AI-supported learning and instant gratification.</p>
<p><strong>Target Customers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals:</strong> Anyone concerned about their personal email security, from tech-savvy users to digital novices seeking to improve their online safety.</li>
<li><strong>Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs):</strong> Looking for cost-effective, engaging, and scalable cybersecurity awareness training solutions for their employees without the overhead of traditional training programs.</li>
<li><strong>Educational Institutions & Non-profits:</strong> Seeking interactive tools to teach digital literacy and internet safety to students or community members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day):</strong></p>
<p>The goal is a functional, bare-bones system that demonstrates the core value proposition of AI-powered gamified feedback on email content.</p>
