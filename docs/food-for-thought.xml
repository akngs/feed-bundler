<h4 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h4>
<p>A collaborative platform where fans of highly specific niche media properties (books, games, lore, indie series) can co-create and expand fanfiction or original shared universe narratives. The core innovation is leveraging AI to act as a creative muse, helping overcome writer's block, suggesting plot points, and ensuring consistency within intricate lore.</p>
<h4 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h4>
<p>Empowers passionate but often underserved niche communities to collectively deepen their engagement and creative output for beloved universes. It transforms passive consumption into active, shared world-building, fostering a unique sense of belonging and collaborative achievement, augmented by intelligent assistance.</p>
<h4 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h4>
<p>Dedicated enthusiasts within micro-fandoms (e.g., fans of obscure sci-fi novels, cult classic video games with deep lore, specific tabletop RPG settings, indie webcomics, or historical reenactment groups with detailed backstories). These are individuals who already spend significant time dissecting and discussing the minutiae of their chosen universe and crave more creative interaction.</p>
<h4 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h4>
<p>This MVP isolates the core value: collaborative, AI-augmented creative writing for niche communities. It's built for rapid iteration and feedback. A single indie dev, fluent in their stack, could set up the basics and the API call within a day.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Public "Story Boards":</strong> A dead-simple landing page displaying a list of "Story Projects," each with a title and a last-updated timestamp. Think a bare-bones public Trello board of story ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Single Story View & Contribution:</strong> Clicking on a Story Project takes the user to a page that shows the current, collaboratively written text of that story. Below it, a single large text area where anyone can type their contribution. A "Submit Chapter" button appends their text to the current story. <em>No user accounts for MVP</em>; contributions can be anonymous or a self-entered nickname.</li>
<li><strong>The AI "Muse" Button:</strong> Crucially, next to the contribution text area, a button labeled "Ask AI for a Spark." When pressed, the system sends the <em>last few paragraphs</em> of the current story to a generative AI API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) with a prompt like "Continue this story with one paragraph." The AI's suggestion then <em>populates</em> the user's contribution text area, acting as a prompt or starting point they can edit before submitting.</li>
<li><strong>Chronological Stream:</strong> The landing page could show a simple chronological stream of the latest "chapters" or updates across all Story Projects, reinforcing the collaborative, evolving nature.</li>
