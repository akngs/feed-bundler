It helps individuals proactively identify potential knowledge gaps and areas of decaying understanding before they become critical issues. By allowing users to log their study topics, self-assess their confidence levels, and track their last engagement, the system acts as a personalized early warning system, nudging them towards timely review and targeted self-intervention.</h2>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition-this-tool-empowers-self-learners-to-take-greater-control-of-their-educational-journey-it-transforms-passive-learning-into-an-active-self-aware-process-significantly-improving-knowledge-retention-and-learning-efficiency-by-anticipating-where-a-user-might-struggle-or-forget-it-minimizes-the-stress-of-forgotten-knowledge-right-when-it-matters-most-fostering-continuous-improvement-and-deeper-understanding">Core Value Proposition This tool empowers self-learners to take greater control of their educational journey. It transforms passive learning into an active, self-aware process, significantly improving knowledge retention and learning efficiency. By anticipating where a user might struggle or forget, it minimizes the stress of 'forgotten knowledge' right when it matters most, fostering continuous improvement and deeper understanding.</h2>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Self-Learners & Independent Students:</strong> Individuals learning new skills (e.g., programming languages, musical instruments, foreign languages, complex software) through online courses, books, or personal projects.</li>
<li><strong>Exam Reviwers:</strong> Students preparing for standardized tests, professional certifications, or university exams, seeking to reinforce their knowledge outside of traditional Learning Management Systems.</li>
<li><strong>Lifelong Learners:</strong> Professionals and hobbyists dedicated to continuous learning across diverse subjects who want to ensure long-term knowledge retention.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>This MVP focuses on core functionality, leveraging simple heuristics for 'prediction' that lay the groundwork for future AI enhancements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> A basic sign-up and login process (e.g., email and password) to allow users to create and access their personalized learning data.</li>
<li><strong>Topic Management Page:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Add Topic:</strong> A simple text input field where users can add new study subjects (e.g., 'React Hooks,' 'Calculus III,' 'Spanish Verb Conjugation').</li>
<li><strong>Self-Assessed Confidence:</strong> For each topic, a quick input (e.g., 1-5 star rating or slider) to reflect their current perceived understanding and confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Last Study Date:</strong> A date picker to log the most recent day the user actively engaged with that topic.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>'Proactive Insight' Dashboard:</strong><ul>
<li>A clean, single-page view listing all the user's topics, their confidence scores, and last study dates.</li>
<li><strong>'At-Risk' Highlighting (Heuristic Prediction):</strong> Implement visual cues (e.g., a red border, a warning icon) for topics that meet one of two simple predictive criteria:<ul>
<li><strong>Low Confidence:</strong> The self-assessed confidence score is 2 or lower.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Decay:</strong> The 'last study date' is more than X days ago (e.g., default X=7 days, user-configurable setting).</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Generic Resource Suggestion:</strong> For each 'at-risk' topic, display a direct, clickable button labeled 'Find Resources' that automatically opens a new browser tab with a Google search for <code>[Topic Name] tutorial</code> or <code>[Topic Name] basic concepts</code>.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Persistent Storage:</strong> Use a simple database (like SQLite for local development or a basic hosted DB for cloud deployment) to store user data (topics, confidence, dates) reliably.</li>
