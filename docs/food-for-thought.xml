Forget verbose documentation and endless meetings to align on code changes. Your next big idea lives at the intersection of AI, software engineering, and collaboration. ## Brief Description IntentDiff is an intelligent, lightweight tool that automatically generates a deeply insightful summary of any given Git diff. Unlike static diff viewers, IntentDiff leverages advanced AI to understand the <em>true intent</em> behind the code changes, identify their potential <em>systemic impact</em>, and even suggest <em>key collaborators</em> who need to be aware. It transforms raw code alterations into a concise, human-readable narrative, bridging the communication gap inherent in modern software development. ## Core Value Proposition IntentDiff dramatically reduces cognitive load, accelerates code review cycles, and minimizes miscommunication within development teams. By autonomously surfacing the "why," "what," and "who" behind code modifications, it fosters superior understanding, speeds up developer onboarding, and ensures tighter team alignment. It's an indispensable co-pilot for any team looking to move faster and smarter without sacrificing clarity. ## Target Customers This tool is designed for individual software developers, small to medium-sized development teams, open-source project maintainers, and distributed engineering groups. Anyone struggling with complex pull requests, frequent context switching, or the challenge of rapidly onboarding new team members will find IntentDiff transformative. ## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day) Your challenge: Build the absolute core of IntentDiff by the end of today. 1.  <strong>Diff Input Interface:</strong> Create a single HTML page with a large, scrollable text area. Label it clearly: "Paste your Git Diff here." Add a prominent "Analyze Diff" button below it. 2.  <strong>Backend Listener:</strong> Implement a minimalist backend service (e.g., a simple Python Flask or Node.js Express endpoint) that listens for POST requests containing the pasted diff text. 3.  <strong>LLM Orchestration:</strong> Integrate with a robust Large Language Model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google's Gemini Pro). Your backend service will relay the diff to this API. 4.  <strong>The Master Prompt:</strong> This is the core intelligence. Craft a precise prompt for the LLM that instructs it to perform <em>all</em> of the following from the provided diff:     *   <strong>Intent:</strong> "Summarize the overarching <em>purpose</em> or <em>goal</em> of these code changes in one to two sentences, in simple business language."     *   <strong>Impact:</strong> "Identify any likely <em>side effects</em>, <em>dependencies</em>, or <em>affected components</em> within the software system."     *   <strong>Collaborators:</strong> "Suggest <em>types of team members</em> (e.g., 'Frontend Dev,' 'QA Specialist,' 'Database Admin') who would be most relevant to this change, with a brief reason for each."     *   <strong>PR Draft:</strong> "Generate a concise, professional pull request description draft based on the above analysis." 5.  <strong>Output Display:</strong> After receiving the LLM's structured response, render it clearly and immediately back onto the HTML page, below the input area. Format it with clear headings for Intent, Impact, Collaborators, and PR Draft. This MVP delivers instant value. No user accounts, no databases, no complex Git platform integrations needed initially. Just pure, unadulterated AI intelligence turning opaque diffs into transparent narratives. Get building.</h1>]]></content:encoded>
