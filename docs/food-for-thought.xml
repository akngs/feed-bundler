<p><strong>"Verifiable Learning Snippets" (VLS)</strong>: A platform that empowers individuals to capture, assess, and formalize knowledge gained from any online content (articles, videos, podcasts, open courses) using AI. It generates verifiable micro-credentials, making informal learning provable and shareable as part of a nascent digital skill identity.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>In an era of ubiquitous information, proving one's self-acquired knowledge is challenging. VLS bridges this gap, transforming casual consumption into demonstrable mastery. We enable individuals to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validate Understanding</strong>: Get AI-powered assessment of comprehension on any self-selected learning material.</li>
<li><strong>Build a Dynamic Skill Portfolio</strong>: Accrue verifiable "knowledge snippets" that showcase continuous, self-directed learning.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance Digital Identity</strong>: Create a shareable, provable record of specific domain understanding, useful for professional networking, personal branding, or even informal educational validation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifelong Learners & Self-Taught Professionals</strong>: Individuals who primarily learn through online resources and wish to formalize their extensive, informal knowledge base.</li>
<li><strong>Career Switchers</strong>: Those demonstrating foundational knowledge in new fields without traditional certifications.</li>
<li><strong>"Skill Stackers"</strong>: People focused on acquiring specific, niche skills and needing a granular way to prove mastery.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Researchers/Creators</strong>: Individuals who synthesize information from diverse sources and want a way to document their learning journey and insights.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day)</h3>
<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build the barebones proof of concept:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input Mechanism</strong>: A simple web form where a user pastes a URL (e.g., an article link, YouTube video URL).</li>
<li><strong>AI Question Generation</strong>: On the backend, an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4) takes the content from the URL (scraped text or transcribed audio/video) and generates 3-5 concise, factual multiple-choice or short-answer questions directly related to that content.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Assessment Interface</strong>: Display these questions to the user. User submits their answers.</li>
<li><strong>Instant Validation</strong>: A simple scoring mechanism checks the user's answers against AI-generated correct answers or a heuristic (e.g., 80% correct for multiple choice, keyword matching for short answer).</li>
<li><strong>Verifiable Link Generation</strong>: If successful, generate a unique, public URL. This URL is the "micro-credential". Navigating to it should display: "Verified Understanding of [Content Title] (Source: [Original URL]) on [Date]. Successfully answered X/Y questions." No user accounts, no complex identity systems, just a persistent, shareable link as proof of a learning event. This URL <em>is</em> their "digital identity" for that specific learning snippet.</li>
