<h2 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h2>
<p>ConsentFlow AI is an AI-powered personal data consent management platform designed to empower individuals with complete control and deep understanding over their digital identity and personal information. It helps users manage, approve, and revoke consent for data sharing with various third-party services, while an intelligent agent proactively flags potentially risky requests.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>In an increasingly data-driven world, individuals feel a pervasive loss of control over their personal information. ConsentFlow AI offers true ownership and granular control, transforming complex, jargon-filled privacy policies into actionable insights. By simplifying the consent process and using AI to highlight potential risks, the platform offers peace of mind and significantly enhances personal privacy, allowing users to make informed decisions about their digital footprint.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<p>This platform is primarily for privacy-conscious individuals, digital nomads, and early adopters of self-sovereign identity principles. It's also ideal for users experiencing fatigue from constant consent banners, cookie pop-ups, and inscrutable terms of service agreements, who desire a simplified, intuitive way to manage their online identity.</p>

<li><strong>Core Data Entry</strong>: Create a simple web application (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) where a user can manually add different types of personal data they might share (e.g., "Email Address," "Phone Number," "Date of Birth," "Browsing History"). This is just a text input field to add new</li>
