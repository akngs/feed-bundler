            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The remote-first world presents a significant challenge: managing the deluge of questions. Students learning online, employees onboarding remotely, community members in asynchronous discussions â€“ they all generate streams of inquiries. Educators and team leads spend countless hours answering the same questions repeatedly. This is inefficient, frustrating, and prevents deeper engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Description:</strong> An AI-powered tool that allows users to get instant answers to common questions based on provided educational or company materials.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition:</strong> Save significant time for educators, team leads, and support staff by offloading repetitive questions to an AI. Empower students and team members with immediate access to information, fostering faster learning and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Target Customers:</strong> Remote educators (course creators, university faculty), online community managers, team leads in remote organizations, HR/Onboarding specialists.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope - Build in a Day:</strong></p>
<p>Create a single web page or a simple backend service with two core functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Context Upload/Input:</strong> A simple way for an educator/admin to paste or input raw text content (e.g., an FAQ document, lecture notes, a section of a manual, transcribed common questions). For the MVP, this can be as simple as a text area on a webpage that holds the content in memory or a temporary file.</li>
<li><strong>Question Answering Interface:</strong> A separate input field where a user can type a question. When submitted, send the user's question <em>and</em> the previously provided context text to an AI API (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). The AI is prompted to answer the question <em>solely</em> based on the provided context. Display the AI's response to the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. No user accounts, no database, no complex document parsing, no integrations, minimal UI. Just input context, ask a question, get an AI answer based <em>only</em> on that context. This core loop demonstrates the value proposition and is absolutely achievable for an indie developer within a focused day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world knit together by complex economic threads, where the distribution of resources and opportunities varies greatly, we see widely divergent experiences of human flourishing. </p>
<p>Considering these observable facts of economic structure and their deep imprint on our social lives, the question arises, simply: </p>
<p>What is the true nature of our shared moral duty in fostering the well-being of others, and to what extent do the systems we build and inhabit help or hinder us in fulfilling it?</p>]]></content:encoded>
