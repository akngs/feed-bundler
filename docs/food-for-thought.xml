<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>In the fast-paced world of biotech and life sciences, researchers are constantly drowning in fragmented informationâ€”lab notes scribbled on whiteboards, experimental parameters in spreadsheets, insightful literature snippets saved as bookmarks, and countless hypotheses bouncing around team chats. This scattered knowledge significantly hinders collaboration, slows down discovery, and often leads to duplicated efforts. </p>
<p><strong>SynapseNotes</strong> is a focused digital workspace designed to transform these disparate pieces of information into an interconnected, AI-augmented knowledge graph. It's a smart scratchpad that empowers individual researchers and small teams to capture, organize, and instantly recall their insights, making previously siloed knowledge immediately accessible and interconnected, fostering a more fluid, discovery-driven research process.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>SynapseNotes offers a profound shift from passive data storage to active knowledge recall. Its core value proposition is to <strong>eliminate the 'lost note' problem and dramatically reduce the cognitive load of information management</strong> for biotech researchers. By intelligently connecting disparate observations, findings, and ideas, it ensures that no valuable insight is ever truly forgotten or isolated. This accelerates research cycles, prevents redundant experiments, and encourages serendipitous connections that drive innovation.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>Our ideal customers are individual <strong>biotech researchers, PhD students, postdocs, and small academic or startup lab teams (1-5 members)</strong>. These are professionals who generate and consume vast amounts of unstructured scientific data daily and struggle with effective information synthesis across their diverse projects and collaborative efforts. They value speed, precision, and the ability to connect concepts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-the-one-day-build">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope: The One-Day Build</h3>
<p>For an indie software developer, the power of SynapseNotes can be demonstrated with a surprisingly simple yet impactful MVP, achievable in a single day. This is about proving the core connection-making hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>MVP Name: BioScratchpad (A SynapseNotes Core Demo)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> A simple web application or a local-first desktop app with a single, prominent text area for input. Users can type or paste <em>any</em> text (lab notes, paper abstracts, observations).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unstructured Note Storage:</strong> Upon hitting 'Save', the application takes the input text and stores it as a new 'note' item. For day one, this can be as simple as saving individual <code>.txt</code> files in a local directory (<code>notes/note_id.txt</code>) or appending entries to a single JSON file (<code>db.json</code>). No user accounts, no complex database setup needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic Note Retrieval & Display:</strong> A sidebar or a separate view lists all previously saved notes (e.g., by their first few words or a timestamp). Clicking a note displays its full content in the main viewing area.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>'AI' Assisted Connection (The Core Innovation):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyword Extraction:</strong> Upon saving a note, or when a note is viewed, the application internally runs a simple, pre-defined function. This function identifies keywords within the note by checking for matches against a <em>hardcoded, small list of 20-50 common biotech/life science terms</em> (e.g., "DNA", "RNA", "protein", "gene", "CRISPR", "mutation", "assay", specific common disease names like "cancer", "diabetes", common experimental techniques like "PCR", "sequencing"). This list is embedded directly in the code for speed.</li>
<li><strong>Related Note Suggestion:</strong> Below the currently viewed note, a small section titled "Related Notes" appears. This section dynamically lists <em>other existing notes</em> from the user's storage that share <em>at least one</em> common keyword with the current note, drawing from that same hardcoded list. Display these simply by their title/first line. No complex scoring, just presence of a shared keyword.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP is highly focused. The 'AI' component is a direct string match, not a large language model call, ensuring it's trivial to implement but immediately demonstrates the value of interlinking. The 'collaboration' starts with the user having a coherent knowledge base, paving the way for shared access and multi-user features. This is the seed for a powerful tool, built in hours.</p>]]></content:encoded>
