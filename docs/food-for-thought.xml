            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We look at the tiny world of molecules in a cell, the long story of life’s evolution across ages, and the busy flow of markets and economies. These things seem very different. Yet, each confronts fundamental pressures: there aren't endless resources, everything costs energy, and processing information is a challenge.</p>
<p>Inside a cell, molecules behave like they are managing a small budget, deciding where proteins and energy should go. Living things, over vast periods, find ways to make do with what’s available to survive and have offspring. Human economies try to share out limited goods and services, driven by how people interact.</p>
<p>Is there a single, deeper idea connecting how these systems work, how they find ways to adapt and change even when things are constrained? Could there be common rules about how they handle limits, get the most out of what they have, and use information—rules that show up whether we look at a molecular network, the history of species, or the trading of goods? Or are the apparent similarities just simple likenesses without deep connections? Thinking about this question across scales might reveal something important about the nature of complex systems that adapt and emerge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>A simple API service that uses AI to automatically analyze unstructured user feedback data (like survey responses, support tickets, or app reviews) and extract key themes, sentiment, and potentially actionable insights.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Product teams, UX researchers, and founders spend countless hours manually sifting through user feedback. The Insight API eliminates this tedious work by providing structured, synthesized insights from messy qualitative data points at scale, enabling faster, data-driven product decisions.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<p>Startups and SMBs with product teams, UX/UI designers, product managers, and customer success departments who collect user feedback via various channels but lack the resources or tools to effectively analyze it systematically.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day)</h2>
<p>Create a single API endpoint (e.g., <code>/analyze_text</code>) that accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing one key, <code>text</code>, representing a single piece of user feedback (e.g., one survey response, one review). The endpoint should perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive the text input.</li>
<li>Make a single call to an existing third-party AI API (e.g., OpenAI's Chat Completion API, Anthropic's API) with a well-crafted prompt. The prompt should instruct the AI to analyze the provided <code>text</code> and extract two pieces of information: the overall sentiment (e.g., 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral') and a list of 1-3 key themes or topics discussed in the text.</li>
<li>Parse the response from the third-party AI API.</li>
<li>Return a JSON response containing the extracted sentiment and themes (as a list of strings). Add basic error handling.</li>
<li>Deploy this single endpoint to a simple, free hosting service (like Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, or a free tier cloud function).</li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP provides core analytical value for single text inputs, demonstrating the potential to scale to batch processing and more sophisticated insights later.</p>]]></content:encoded>
