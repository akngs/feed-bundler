Instead of passively storing knowledge, the Cognition Compass intelligently observes your current digital context (e.g., active application, document, time of day) and proactively presents relevant insights, strategies, or principles you've previously internalized and input. It bridges the gap between learning and doing, ensuring your most valuable self-help knowledge is always present and actionable exactly when you need it, guiding your decisions and reinforcing your desired behaviors in real-time.\n\n## Core Value Proposition\nTransforms passive knowledge into active, context-aware cognitive augmentation. It eliminates the friction of recalling relevant information by acting as a proactive "second brain" that delivers personalized wisdom at the opportune moment, thereby enhancing decision-making, reinforcing positive habits, and fostering continuous self-improvement aligned with your personal growth goals.\n\n## Target Customers\nIndividuals committed to personal growth, lifelong learners, knowledge workers, entrepreneurs, students, and anyone who invests in self-help resources but struggles to consistently apply learned principles in their day-to-day life. Those who feel overwhelmed by information or desire better integration of their intellectual capital into practical action.\n\n## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day)\nThe goal is to deliver the core "contextual wisdom delivery" loop in a single day.\n\n1.  <strong>Wisdom Vault (Data Storage):</strong> A simple desktop application (e.g., built with Python/Electron/Tauri for cross-platform) that allows users to input short text snippets of wisdom (quotes, personal insights, productivity hacks, learned principles) along with optional, comma-separated tags (e.g., "focus", "decision", "morning"). This data is stored locally in a basic format like a JSON file.\n2.  <strong>Context Snapshot:</strong> The application gains the ability to identify the title of the user's currently active window (e.g., "Google Chrome - How to build an MVP", "VS Code - project-readme.md", "Outlook - Inbox").\n3.  <strong>Intelligent Retrieval (Basic):</strong> When activated, the system takes the active window title and performs a basic keyword extraction (e.g., splits words, removes common stop words). It then searches the Wisdom Vault, prioritizing nuggets whose tags or content closely match these extracted keywords. If no strong matches, it falls back to displaying a random relevant nugget or one from a "default" category.\n4.  <strong>Subtle Nudge (Display):</strong> The selected wisdom nugget is presented in a small, non-intrusive floating window or a native desktop notification that appears briefly and dismisses itself after a few seconds or on a click. This maintains focus while still providing the nudge.\n5.  <strong>Activation Mechanism:</strong> A simple "Get Wisdom" button within the application's UI, or a global hotkey if easily implemented within the chosen framework (e.g., via system tray/menu bar icon context menu).\n\nThis MVP establishes the foundational loop: Input Wisdom -&gt; Contextual Trigger -&gt; Smart Retrieval -&gt; Timely Nudge. It's an external cognitive aid that brings your own personalized "extended mind" to bear on your immediate situation.</h1>]]></content:encoded>
