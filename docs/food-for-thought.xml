            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The environmental challenges of our era demand not just global strategies but also hyper-local action. Communities are brimming with innovative, sustainable practicesâ€”from neighborhood compost schemes and local repair cafes to energy-saving tips tailored to specific climates. Yet, this invaluable knowledge often remains fragmented, unshared, or hard to discover.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>EcoLoca Wiki</strong> comes in.</p>
<p><strong>EcoLoca Wiki</strong> is not just another platform; it's an intelligent, collaborative ecosystem designed to empower communities to curate, share, and expand their hyper-local knowledge of sustainable living. Imagine a wiki where you can instantly find the nearest zero-waste store, learn about a community garden initiative in your district, or discover a hack for reducing energy consumption specific to your home type, all contributed and vetted by your neighbors.</p>
<h3 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief description of the idea</h3>
<p>An AI-augmented, community-driven wiki for hyper-local sustainable practices, resources, and initiatives. It transforms dispersed knowledge into an accessible, actionable, and continuously growing hub of eco-conscious living.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core value proposition</h3>
<p>Empowers local communities to effortlessly discover, share, and enhance neighborhood-specific sustainable living solutions, leveraging AI to intelligently organize, generate, and highlight impactful eco-friendly actions, reducing environmental footprint one local tip at a time.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target customers</h3>
<p>Environmentally conscious urban and suburban residents, local community groups (e.g., gardening clubs, eco-activist networks), small businesses offering sustainable products/services (e.g., refill stores, repair shops), and local government initiatives seeking to promote green living.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-which-can-be-implemented-in-a-day">Minimum viable product (MVP) scope which can be implemented in a day</h3>
<p>Your mission for today: Build a single-page web application demonstrating the core loop of EcoLoca Wiki.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The "New Entry" Form:</strong> At the top of your page, design a prominent input section. Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large <code>textarea</code> labeled: "Share Your Hyper-Local Eco-Tip Here (e.g., 'Community compost drop-off every Sat.')"</li>
<li>A small <code>input</code> field labeled: "Location (e.g., 'Queens, NYC' or 'Central London'):"</li>
<li>A single <code>button</code> labeled: "Generate AI Draft &amp; Submit."</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The AI Engine (Behind the Button):</strong> Upon clicking "Generate AI Draft &amp; Submit":</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your client-side JavaScript will <code>fetch</code> to a <em>simple serverless function</em> (or directly to an LLM API if you're comfortable with client-side keys for a dev demo).</p></li>
<li><p>This function sends a concise prompt to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or Claude):</p>
<pre><code>Act as a hyper-local sustainability wiki editor. Take the following raw tip for "[User's Location]" and format it into a concise, actionable wiki-style entry. Suggest a clear title and add 1-2 relevant local keywords.

Raw tip: "[User's Eco-Tip Content]"</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The LLM's response should return a structured text containing a <code>Title</code>, <code>Wiki Content</code>, and <code>Keywords</code>.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The "Wiki" Display:</strong> Below the form, create a section to display wiki entries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardcoded Examples:</strong> Pre-populate this section with 3-5 <em>static, hardcoded</em> example wiki entries that illustrate the ideal format (Title, Content, Keywords, Location). These act as the initial "wiki" content.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Append:</strong> When the AI response for a user's tip is received, append this <em>newly generated entry</em> to the top of the displayed list (client-side only, no persistence needed for day 1). This vividly shows the wiki's growth and AI's role.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP, achievable in a single focused day, clearly showcases the unique blend of AI, sustainability, and community-driven wiki knowledge, providing a tangible starting point for an inspiring year ahead.</p>]]></content:encoded>
