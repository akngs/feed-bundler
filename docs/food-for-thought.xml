<h2 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h2>
<p>Imagine a world where your smart home doesn't just respond to commands, but actively <em>understands</em> the identities and behaviors of its connected devices. Project Aegis is an AI-powered platform designed to provide dynamic, adaptive identity verification and access control for IoT devices within a home network. Instead of static credentials, Aegis leverages machine learning to build a unique behavioral fingerprint for each device and user. This allows it to automatically detect, and even preempt, unauthorized access attempts or anomalous device behavior, creating a self-defending, truly smart home ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Project Aegis offers unparalleled security and convenience for smart home inhabitants. By eliminating the reliance on cumbersome, static credential management, users gain peace of mind knowing their devices are constantly monitored and protected. The system adapts to daily routines and learns typical device interactions, proactively identifying and quarantining potential threats. This shifts the paradigm from reactive threat response to proactive, identity-based security, making smart homes genuinely intelligent and secure without constant user intervention. "Your home knows what's normal, and fiercely defends against what isn't."</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Home Enthusiasts & Early Adopters:</strong> Individuals deeply invested in smart home technology, seeking cutting-edge security and a more autonomous experience.</li>
<li><strong>Families & Multi-User Households:</strong> Those with numerous devices and users, who struggle with managing access and ensuring privacy across the network.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy & Security-Conscious Individuals:</strong> Users deeply concerned about data breaches, unauthorized access to IoT devices, and the privacy implications of always-on sensors.</li>
<li><strong>Small Businesses / Home Offices (SOHO):</strong> Entities utilizing smart devices for security, environmental control, or productivity, requiring robust and low-maintenance network defenses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-iot-network-listener-unexpected-connection-detector-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope: "IoT Network Listener: Unexpected Connection Detector" (Implementable in a day)</h2>
<p>This MVP focuses on the most critical aspect of identity: a device's expected communication patterns. Deviations indicate a potential identity compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> A standalone Python script that monitors <em>one</em> specific IoT device for <em>unexpected outbound network connections</em>.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Device IP Configuration:</strong> The user provides the local IP address of a single IoT device they wish to monitor (e.g., smart light bulb, security camera).</li>
<li><strong>Whitelist Creation:</strong> The script attempts to build an initial, simple whitelist of trusted destination IP addresses/domains that the device <em>normally</em> communicates with (e.g., the manufacturer's cloud servers). This can be manually assisted by running the script in a</li>
