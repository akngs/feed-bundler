<p>An AI system that creates a dynamic, context-aware digital identity—a "Presence Persona"—for individuals within smart environments (homes, offices). It intelligently infers <em>who</em> is present and their <em>likely activities or needs</em> by leveraging privacy-respecting data from ambient IoT sensors (Wi-Fi device presence, Bluetooth signals, motion sensors, smart device usage). This persona enables hyper-personalized, non-intrusive automation.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hyper-Personalized Automation</strong>: Moves beyond rigid rules, allowing IoT devices to intuitively adapt to the specific individuals present and their context. Imagine lights dimming automatically when <em>you</em> settle down to read, distinct from when someone else enters the room.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Privacy</strong>: Emphasizes the use of non-visual, ambient sensor data, putting users in control of their digital identity's exposure within their physical space, reducing reliance on intrusive cameras or always-listening mics.</li>
<li><strong>Effortless Adaptation</strong>: The system learns and refines its understanding over time, significantly reducing the manual configuration typically required for complex smart routines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Early adopters and tech enthusiasts seeking truly intelligent and adaptive smart home experiences beyond simple routines.</li>
<li>Privacy-conscious individuals looking for alternatives to existing smart home solutions that might over-collect data.</li>
<li>Small offices or collaborative spaces desiring personalized environmental controls without overt surveillance for their teams and guests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>The goal here is to demonstrate the core concept rapidly. This MVP is about building the minimal feedback loop of <em>input -> interpretation -> output</em> that forms the basis of the Presence Persona. The "AI" is initially a set of clear rules that you <em>intend</em> to evolve into machine learning algorithms later. The "IoT" is simulated input representing real sensors. The "Digital Identity" is the authenticated user linked to these interpretations.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Digital Identity Foundation</strong>: A lightweight user authentication system (e.g., a simple local username/password login or integration with a readily available OAuth provider like Google). The system will initially support a single primary user for proof of concept.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated IoT Sensor Input</strong>: Instead of connecting to physical IoT devices immediately, provide a basic web interface (or command-line tool) with toggle switches or simple input fields that <em>simulate</em> sensor data:<ul>
<li>A "User's Phone Connected to Wi-Fi" toggle.</li>
<li>A "Motion Detected in Living Room" button.</li>
<li>A "Door Opened" button.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Basic Presence Persona Logic (Rule-Based "AI")</strong>: Implement rudimentary <code>if-then</code> rules that combine the simulated inputs to infer a very basic "Presence Persona" status. Examples:<ul>
<li>If "User's Phone Connected" AND "Motion Detected", set "User is Active Home."</li>
<li>If "User's Phone Connected" AND "No Motion for 5 min", set "User is Relaxing/Asleep Home."</li>
<li>If "User's Phone Disconnected", set "User is Away."</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Display & Log</strong>: A simple dashboard page that displays the current inferred "Presence Persona" status (e.g., "Current Status: User is Active Home") and logs recent status transitions. This immediately shows the system's core capability of interpreting raw sensor input into meaningful identity states.</li>
