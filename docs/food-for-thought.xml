<p><strong>Brief Description:</strong><br />
Offer an API endpoint that takes simple inputs about a software application or website (e.g., type of data collected, purpose, third parties used) and uses an AI model to generate a tailored draft privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition:</strong><br />
Democratize access to essential legal documentation. Save indie developers and small businesses significant time and potential legal costs by providing an instant, customized draft privacy policy based on their specific needs, bridging the gap between generic templates and expensive legal counsel.</p>
<p><strong>Target Customers:</strong><br />
Indie software developers, small bootstrapped startups, freelance web designers, small e-commerce site owners â€“ anyone building and deploying digital products or services who needs a privacy policy but lacks legal expertise or budget.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope - Implementable in a Day:</strong><br />
Create a single API endpoint (e.g., <code>/generate_policy</code>). This endpoint accepts a POST request with a simple JSON body. The JSON would contain just one or two key text fields: <code>app_description</code> (a brief summary of the app/service) and maybe <code>data_types_collected</code> (a comma-separated list). The endpoint's core logic is to take this input, construct a specific, simple prompt for a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 or equivalent (e.g., "Generate a draft privacy policy for a service described as: [app_description]. It collects these types of data: [data_types_collected]. Focus on standard clauses like data collection, usage, disclosure, user rights, and contact info. Output only the policy text."), call the LLM API, and return the raw text response from the LLM as the API response. No user authentication, no persistent storage, no complex templates, just the API wrapper around the AI call.</p>
<p>This one-day MVP provides a raw utility function. Users interact with it programmatically (curl, simple script). It's far from a polished product, but it instantly validates the core AI-powered utility proposition and establishes the API foundation.</p>]]></content:encoded>
