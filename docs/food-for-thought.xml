            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The information age promised boundless knowledge, yet it delivered overwhelming noise. We're drowning in a deluge of news, often repetitive, biased, or sensationalized. Staying truly informed requires an immense investment of time and critical discernment.</p>
<h3 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h3>
<p>Imagine a platform that intelligently curates and summarizes breaking news, transforming a constant stream of articles into a meticulously organized, chronological wiki of ongoing events. This <strong>ChronoWiki</strong> would use AI to distill key facts and updates, then empower a community to collaboratively build an objective, evolving narrative around any significant global event, complete with source attribution and historical context. Itâ€™s about building a living, breathing encyclopedia of current affairs, free from redundant headlines and built on the aggregated, vetted essence of information.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>For anyone overwhelmed by information overload and struggling to extract objective truth from the daily news cycle, ChronoWiki offers clarity and context. It eliminates news fatigue by providing concise, fact-checked summaries, organized chronologically within a broader event narrative. Users gain a comprehensive, verifiable understanding of how events unfold over time, without sifting through countless articles or succumbing to partisan spin. It transforms passive news consumption into active, collaborative knowledge building.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Engaged Citizen:</strong> Individuals who want to stay informed about critical global or local events but lack the time or patience to consume news from dozens of sources daily.</li>
<li><strong>Students & Researchers:</strong> Requiring a consolidated, evolving timeline and summary of specific topics or historical events for academic or professional purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Journalists & Analysts:</strong> Seeking a rapid, contextualized overview of developing stories and a platform for verifying factual progression.</li>
<li><strong>Community-Oriented Knowledge Seekers:</strong> Those who value collaborative fact-checking and the power of collective intelligence to build reliable information resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>This MVP strips away all but the absolute core. Your goal for today is to demonstrate the <strong>AI-powered chronological aggregation of news summaries.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single, Hardcoded "Event Page":</strong> Begin with just one predefined, hardcoded event (e.g., "Future of AI Regulation" or "Mars Colony Development"). No user creation or selection of events for now.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Article Input:</strong> Create a basic web page with a single large text area where <strong>you (the developer)</strong> can paste the raw content of a news article.</li>
<li><strong>"Summarize & Add" Button:</strong> A button next to the input area. On click:<ul>
<li>Take the text from the input area.</li>
<li>Send it to a pre-configured AI summarization API (e.g., a free tier of a public API like OpenAI, or even a local lightweight model if you have one ready for quick setup).</li>
<li>Display the AI-generated 3-5 sentence summary on the page.</li>
<li>Below the summary, automatically add a timestamp (current date/time) and a simple line for the original source (e.g., "Source: [Manually input URL here - tiny text field]").</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Chronological Display:</strong> Each new summary entry (summary, timestamp, source) should be appended to a list below, ordered chronologically (newest at the top).</li>
<li><strong>No Persistence (Day 1):</strong> Data is only stored in browser memory. A page refresh clears everything. The objective is to visually prove the concept, not build a database.</li>
<li><strong>No User Accounts, No Editing, No Wiki Features:</strong> The "wiki" concept is currently just the chronological list of summaries; collaborative and editing features are future scope. This MVP is solely about you demonstrating the AI's ability to condense information and present it in a simple, evolving timeline.</li>
