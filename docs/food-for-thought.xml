<p>Imagine a world where conducting customer interviews for your B2B SaaS no longer means days of transcribing, re-listening, and manually sifting through hours of audio to find key insights. The "Insight Miner" is an AI-powered tool that automates the tedious parts of qualitative user research, transforming raw audio recordings of customer conversations into actionable summaries, identified themes, and potent direct quotes. This allows product managers, founders, and user researchers to focus on <em>what</em> customers are saying, rather than the laborious <em>how</em> of analysis.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Drastically reduce the time and effort required to synthesize insights from B2B customer interviews. Product teams gain immediate, concise access to critical user pain points, needs, and feedback, enabling faster, more informed product decisions without extensive manual data processing. It democratizes sophisticated research analysis for teams without dedicated research operations.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>B2B SaaS Founders & Product Managers:</strong> Running customer discovery, validating ideas, or improving existing features.</li>
<li><strong>User Researchers & UX Designers:</strong> Conducting qualitative studies to understand user behavior and sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Small to Medium-sized B2B Businesses:</strong> Needing efficient ways to gather customer intelligence without a large research budget or dedicated personnel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your challenge for today is to build a single, focused web page that delivers core value:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Audio Upload:</strong> A simple HTML form element allowing users to upload an audio file (e.g., MP3, WAV, M4A) of a customer interview.</li>
<li><strong>Server-Side Processing (The Brain):</strong><ul>
<li>Upon receiving the audio, leverage a leading <strong>Speech-to-Text API</strong> (e.g., OpenAI Whisper API, AssemblyAI) to generate an accurate transcription of the conversation.</li>
<li>Feed this raw transcript into a <strong>Large Language Model (LLM) API</strong> (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku) with a precisely engineered prompt. The prompt's goal is to instruct the LLM to:<ul>
<li>Generate a concise, bullet-point summary of the entire conversation (3-5 key points).</li>
<li>Identify 3-5 recurring themes or main topics discussed (e.g., "Pricing objections," "Integration challenges," "Feature requests for X").</li>
<li>Extract 2-3 compelling, direct quotes from the conversation that highlight a significant pain point, a clear need, or a key insight.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Output Display:</strong> Present the raw transcript, the AI-generated summary, key themes, and extracted quotes clearly on the same web page. Allow users to easily copy the generated text. Focus on functionality over aesthetics for the MVP.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key to "in a day":</strong> Avoid user accounts, project management, sharing features, or complex UIs. Rely entirely on external APIs for transcription and summarization. Your task is the orchestrator, connecting powerful AI tools to solve a specific B2B pain point rapidly.</p>]]></content:encoded>
