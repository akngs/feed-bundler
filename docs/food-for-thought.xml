Forget simply summarizing; imagine a tool that extracts the very essence of narrative, connecting dots, revealing patterns, and building comprehensive knowledge graphs from any written work. This isn't just about reading; it's about truly <em>understanding</em> and <em>analyzing</em> literature at scale.\n\n### Brief description of the idea\n\nDevelop an AI-powered service that takes unstructured literary text (books, articles, research papers, scripts, etc.) and transforms it into structured data formats like JSON or a conceptual knowledge graph. This involves identifying entities (characters, locations, events, themes), their attributes, and the explicit or implicit relationships between them, all via large language models (LLMs).\n\n### Core Value Proposition\n\nLiberate hidden insights and accelerate research, writing, and understanding by converting any literary corpus into queryable, machine-readable datasets. Empower users to visualize narrative structures, track thematic development, compare character interactions across works, or rapidly extract specific factual information, transcending manual reading and note-taking limitations.\n\n### Target Customers\n\n*   <strong>Academic Researchers & Students</strong>: For literary analysis, historical research, comparative studies, and thesis preparation across extensive bodies of work.\n*   <strong>Authors & Screenwriters</strong>: For world-building consistency, character arc mapping, plot structure analysis, and in-depth research for new projects.\n*   <strong>Publishing Houses & Content Strategists</strong>: For analyzing trends, audience preferences, and cross-referencing intellectual property assets.\n*   <strong>Data Journalists & Fact-Checkers</strong>: To rapidly extract and verify information from reports, historical documents, or public statements.\n\n### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day)\n\n<strong>"Character Interaction Extractor"</strong>\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate the core capability of transforming text into structured data focusing on a highly relatable literary aspect: character relationships. Here's how:\n\n1.  <strong>Simple Web Interface</strong>: A single page with a text area or file upload (<code>.txt</code> only) where a user can paste or upload a short story excerpt or a chapter from a book.\n2.  <strong>LLM Integration</strong>: On submission, send the text to a readily available LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or even a local open-source model). The prompt instructs the LLM to:\n    *   Identify all named characters within the provided text.\n    *   For each character, identify other characters they explicitly interact with or mention.\n    *   Briefly describe the nature of that interaction/mention.\n    *   <strong>Crucially, request the output in a strict JSON format</strong> (e.g., <code>[{"character": "Name", "interactions": [{"with": "Other Name", "description": "Action/Description"}, ...]}]</code>).\n3.  <strong>Display Output</strong>: Parse the JSON response from the LLM and display it directly on the webpage, perhaps prettified. No fancy graph visualization needed for this MVP; the raw, structured data is the value proposition here.\n\nThis MVP immediately proves the concept: unstructured literary text goes in, structured, queryable data comes out, ready for further analysis or visualization. Focus on making this single extraction type robust and reliable.</h3>]]></content:encoded>
