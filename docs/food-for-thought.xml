<p>"Ghost App Tracker" is a minimalist desktop utility designed to reveal and monitor the hidden network activities of applications on your system. It continuously scans for running processes and their outbound network connections, silently learning your normal usage patterns. When an application initiates an unusual or previously unseen connection, Ghost App Tracker alerts you, offering an unprecedented level of transparency and control over your digital privacy and cybersecurity posture. It helps you identify "shadow IT" – applications or services running unnoticed – before they can cause privacy breaches or security risks.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Empower individuals and small teams with real-time awareness and control over their software's network behavior, ensuring data privacy and enhancing cybersecurity by proactively flagging suspicious or unexpected communication channels. Turn the black box of background processes into a transparent operational log, giving you peace of mind that your data isn't being silently accessed or transmitted without your knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy-conscious professionals:</strong> Freelancers, remote workers, and consultants handling sensitive data who need to ensure their tools aren't "leaking" information.</li>
<li><strong>Indie developers & tech enthusiasts:</strong> Individuals keen on understanding and controlling their system's exact network interactions beyond standard firewalls.</li>
<li><strong>Small businesses:</strong> Teams without dedicated IT security staff who need a simple, effective tool to monitor application compliance and potential data exfiltration risks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>The goal for this MVP is a functional, basic prototype that demonstrates the core value. A skilled indie developer, leveraging existing system APIs and libraries, can bring this to life quickly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Process & Connection Discovery:</strong> Continuously list all running processes and their active outbound network connections (executable path, destination IP/domain, and port).</li>
<li><strong>Basic Behavioral Baseline:</strong> Implement a simple, local, persistent database (e.g., SQLite, a JSON file) to store every unique <code>(executable_path, destination_IP/domain)</code> pair observed since the application started. This acts as the "known good" or "learned normal" list.</li>
<li><strong>"New Activity" Alerting:</strong> When a process attempts to establish an outbound connection to a destination <em>never before seen</em> for that specific executable path in the baseline, trigger a prominent system notification (e.g., toast notification, console output).</li>
<li><strong>User Triage & Whitelisting:</strong> The triggered notification should allow the user to immediately "Mark as Safe." Clicking this button adds the newly observed <code>(executable_path, destination_IP/domain)</code> pair to the behavioral baseline, preventing future alerts for that specific connection. An option to "Mark as Suspicious" could also be included, simply logging it without adding to the baseline for future review.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Log View:</strong> A minimal UI (a simple window or even a command-line interface) to display recently flagged activities and potentially the full list of observed connections and their current "safe" status.</li>
