            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>A micro-SaaS idea: build a simple web tool that leverages AI to quickly generate bite-sized, actionable cybersecurity awareness content (like short tips or quiz questions) for employees of small businesses. The focus is on rapid content generation on specific topics like phishing, strong passwords, or software updates, without requiring deep cybersecurity expertise from the user or the developer initially.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Small businesses often lack dedicated IT security personnel and struggle to provide their employees with essential cybersecurity training. This tool offers an easy, low-cost way for them to generate basic, tailored awareness material on demand, improving their team's security posture with minimal effort. For the developer, it's a quick entry point into the AI + Cybersecurity space.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<p>Owners, managers, or HR personnel in small businesses (typically 5-50 employees) who need a simple way to educate their team about cybersecurity risks.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>Create a single-page web application. The page should contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>A dropdown menu or radio buttons to select a core cybersecurity topic (e.g., "Phishing Recognition", "Creating Strong Passwords", "Software Update Importance").</li>
<li>An optional text input field for "Employee Role" (e.g., "Office Staff", "Sales Team", "Technical Support").</li>
<li>A button labeled "Generate Security Tip".</li>
<li>A display area (e.g., a <code>div</code> or <code>textarea</code>) where the generated content will appear.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the button is clicked, trigger a call to a large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar). The API call's prompt should be carefully constructed: "Generate a concise, actionable cybersecurity tip (under 150 words) about [Selected Topic], relevant for a [Optional Role, if provided] in a small business setting." Display the text response from the API in the display area.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation Notes for a Day:</strong> Use a front-end framework/library you are familiar with (React, Vue, Svelte, or even plain HTML/JS). Use <code>fetch</code> or a library like Axios for the API call. The API key can be configured client-side (caution advised, maybe use a simple serverless function wrapper if you have more than an hour left). Focus purely on the single function: input -&gt; API call -&gt; output display. No user accounts, no saving, no history, no advanced formatting. Use a free or low-cost LLM tier.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>
