<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>"The Ergonomic Sentinel" is an AI-powered desktop application or web service that utilizes a standard webcam to continuously monitor a user's sitting posture. When slouching, forward head posture, or other poor ergonomic positions are detected for a sustained period, the system provides gentle, real-time auditory or visual cues, helping users cultivate healthier work habits and prevent musculoskeletal strain.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>This solution dramatically reduces the incidence of common posture-related issues such as back pain, neck stiffness, and repetitive strain injuries. By offering accessible, personalized, and non-intrusive ergonomic guidance, it empowers individuals to improve their long-term musculoskeletal health and maintain comfort and productivity during extended periods of seated work or study.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<p>Our primary target customers are remote workers, office professionals, students, and gamers â€“ essentially, anyone who spends a significant portion of their day seated at a desk. These individuals are keenly aware of the physical discomfort that can arise from poor posture and are actively seeking solutions for better ergonomic health.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>The essence of an impactful MVP for indie developers is hyper-focus on a single, core problem with a minimal, functional solution. For "The Ergonomic Sentinel," the MVP focuses purely on detecting a prominent issue: <strong>forward head posture</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology Stack</strong>: A simple web-based application utilizing <code>TensorFlow.js</code> and the <code>MediaPipe Pose</code> model (readily available for browser environments). Alternatively, a Python script with <code>OpenCV</code> and <code>MediaPipe Pose</code> for a desktop application.</li>
<li><strong>Core Functionality</strong>: <ol>
<li><strong>Webcam Integration</strong>: The app requests and displays a live feed from the user's webcam.</li>
<li><strong>Basic AI Detection</strong>: Using <code>MediaPipe Pose</code>, the system will identify key facial and shoulder landmarks (e.g., nose, ears, shoulders). The AI's job is <em>not</em> to perform full skeleton analysis or complex biomechanics but to apply a simple rule: if the <code>x</code>-coordinate of the ear (or nose) key point consistently deviates too far forward relative to the <code>x</code>-coordinate of the shoulder key point for a pre-defined duration (e.g., 10-15 seconds), it indicates forward head posture.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Feedback</strong>: When forward head posture is detected and sustained beyond the threshold, a non-intrusive, gentle auditory cue (e.g., a soft chime or short, pleasant sound) is played. No complex UI changes or AR overlays are needed for this initial MVP. The goal is just a subtle, immediate alert.</li></ol></li>
</ul>
<p>This lean MVP establishes the crucial camera-to-AI-to-feedback loop, validating the core value proposition without requiring extensive UI development or advanced posture analytics.</p>]]></content:encoded>
