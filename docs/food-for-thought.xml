<p>The Infinite Learner is an AI-powered personal learning assistant that constructs and leverages a unique, dynamic knowledge graph for each user. Unlike traditional note-taking or spaced repetition systems, this tool actively understands and maps a user's acquired knowledge, identifying connections, gaps, and areas for deeper exploration across all consumed learning materials â€“ from notes and articles to podcasts and video transcripts.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Transform passive learning into an active, deeply integrated, and personalized journey. The Infinite Learner accelerates understanding, enhances long-term retention, and fosters true mastery by continuously building a bespoke understanding of <em>your</em> knowledge landscape. It acts as an intelligent learning companion, helping you navigate complex subjects by connecting new information to your existing understanding, rather than treating each piece of content in isolation.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifelong Learners:</strong> Individuals committed to continuous personal and professional development.</li>
<li><strong>University Students & Researchers:</strong> Those grappling with vast amounts of academic material and needing to build interconnected understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Professionals Upskilling:</strong> Engineers, doctors, lawyers, and others who must rapidly acquire expertise in new domains or stay current in fast-evolving fields.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Educators:</strong> Anyone using online courses, books, and articles to teach themselves new skills or subjects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>An indie developer can ship the fundamental concept within 24 hours. The MVP focuses solely on demonstrating the core knowledge graph construction from user input.</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple Web Interface:</strong> A single page with a large text area and a "Process" button.</li>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Users paste raw text (e.g., a paragraph from an article, a concept definition) into the text area.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Extraction:</strong> Upon clicking "Process," the system sends the text to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5/4, Claude Sonnet/Opus).</li>
<li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> The LLM is prompted to: "Extract key entities and their semantic relationships from the following text. Present them as a list of subject-predicate-object triplets."  For example, for "The cat sat on the mat," the output might be ("cat", "sat on", "mat").</li>
<li><strong>Raw Output Display:</strong> The extracted triplets are displayed directly below the input area in a simple, human-readable list format (no complex graph visualization needed for MVP). For example:
```
Extracted Relationships:<ul>
<li>(Apollo program, is a type of, human spaceflight missions)</li>
<li>(Apollo program, conducted by, NASA)</li>
<li>(Apollo 11, landed first humans on, Moon)<br />
```</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP, despite its simplicity, establishes the critical foundation: the ability to programmatically turn unstructured text into structured, interconnected knowledge. It's a powerful seed from which a truly transformative learning platform can grow.</p>]]></content:encoded>
