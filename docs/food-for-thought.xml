<p><strong>Brief Description:</strong> A micro-SaaS tool leveraging simplified AI/predictive techniques to help individuals and organizations identify and mitigate subtle gender bias in written communications, particularly job descriptions and internal announcements.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition:</strong> Provides immediate, actionable feedback to foster more equitable language, thereby helping attract a wider, more diverse talent pool and cultivating a more inclusive workplace culture. It directly contributes to feminist goals by addressing systemic linguistic bias at its source.</p>
<p><strong>Target Customers:</strong> Small to medium-sized businesses, HR departments, recruiters, hiring managers, internal communications teams, independent hiring consultants, and even non-profit organizations focused on gender equity.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day):</strong> A single-page web application.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> A large text area where a user can paste a piece of text (e.g., a job description).</li>
<li><strong>Analysis Button:</strong> A button that triggers the analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Rules Engine:</strong> A hardcoded, small dictionary or list of common words/phrases known to be statistically associated with masculine or feminine leaning bias (this list can be compiled from publicly available research or examples found online). Think terms like "ninja," "rockstar," "aggressive," "dominant" (masculine) versus "support," "nurture," "collaboration," "harmony" (feminine) or gendered pronouns used inconsistently.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> The original text displayed again, with any words/phrases from the predefined list simply <em>highlighted</em> or marked in some basic way (e.g., bolded, colored). Below the text, list the identified words/phrases.</li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP provides a tangible utility instantly: basic identification of potentially biased terms based on simple rules, achievable by hardcoding the lookup logic against a small dictionary. It lays the groundwork for future AI/NLP enhancements and more sophisticated predictive analysis on a larger dataset, but the core value of identifying potential bias is delivered from day one using minimal resources.</p>]]></content:encoded>
