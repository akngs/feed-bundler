<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>Navigating the vast and often confusing landscape of health information is a significant challenge for individuals globally. This idea proposes an AI-powered, personalized health wiki that empowers users to build and curate their own reliable knowledge base, tailored precisely to their unique health profile, conditions, and interests. Instead of sifting through generic medical websites, users receive concise, easy-to-understand, and highly relevant information on demand, intelligently organized for them.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalized Clarity</strong>: Eliminate information overload. Get only the health facts, explanations, and insights most relevant to <em>your</em> specific health journey, presented in plain language.</li>
<li><strong>Empowerment Through Knowledge</strong>: Foster better health literacy and decision-making by making complex medical information accessible and actionable. Understand your body, your conditions, and your treatment options like never before.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Knowledge Management</strong>: Create a continuously growing, private, and searchable repository of health insights, acting as your personal, trusted reference for all things health-related.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals with Chronic Conditions</strong>: People managing long-term health issues (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune diseases) who need ongoing, focused information and clarity on their specific condition, medications, and lifestyle adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Caregivers</strong>: Those responsible for a loved one's health, seeking to quickly understand specific diagnoses, prognoses, and care requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Health-Conscious Individuals</strong>: People pursuing specific wellness goals (e.g., personalized nutrition plans, mental health strategies, fitness regimes) who want curated, science-backed information without generic noise.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone Overwhelmed by Health Information</strong>: Users who feel lost in the sea of conflicting or complex online medical advice and desire a simplified, personalized source of truth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-the-personal-health-snippet-ai-one-day-implementation">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope: The "Personal Health Snippet AI" (One-Day Implementation)</h2>
<p>This MVP focuses on the absolute core: immediate, personalized information retrieval and storage.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Allow a user to ask a health-related question and store the AI's concise answer for future reference.</p>
<h3 id="core-components">Core Components:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple User Interface (Frontend)</strong>: A single webpage with a prominent text input field and a submit button. Below this, a display area for results and a list of past queries/answers.</li>
<li><strong>AI Integration (Backend/API)</strong>: Integrate with an existing large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini Pro). <em>Your primary task here is API key management and making HTTP requests.</em></li>
<li><strong>Basic Persistence (Backend/Storage)</strong>: A minimalist way to store query-answer pairs. For a one-day build, this could be as simple as local browser storage, a basic SQLite database file, or a simple JSON file if server-side.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="implementation-steps-sketch">Implementation Steps (Sketch):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML Structure</strong>: Create an <code>index.html</code> with a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> for the health question, a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> for submission, and a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to display the AI's response.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript (Client-Side)</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>User Input Capture</strong>: Add an event listener to the submit button. When clicked, retrieve the text from the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>. Should be less than 2000 characters for initial scope.</li>
<li><strong>API Call</strong>: Send the user's query to your backend endpoint (or directly to the LLM API if doing pure client-side for initial test, though server-side is recommended for API key security).</li>
<li><strong>Response Handling</strong>: Receive the AI-generated text response. Display it in the designated <code>div</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Local Storage (MVP Wiki)</strong>: Immediately after receiving the AI response, store the original query and the AI's answer as a JSON object in the browser's <code>localStorage</code> (e.g., <code>localStorage.setItem('healthWikiEntries', JSON.stringify(currentEntriesArray))</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Display Past Entries</strong>: On page load, retrieve all stored entries from <code>localStorage</code> and display them as a simple, scrollable list (e.g., <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;**Question:** [Q]&lt;br&gt;**Answer:** [A]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>).</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Backend (Optional, but recommended for production-ready MVP beyond Day 1)</strong>:<ul>
<li>A simple serverless function (AWS Lambda, Vercel Function, etc.) or a small Node.js/Python server that takes the user query, securely calls the LLM API with your API key, and returns the response. This abstracts API key handling and could facilitate database integration later.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
