<p><strong>Brief description of the idea</strong></p>
<p>NudgeFin is a lean, AI-powered tool designed to help users identify and optimize their recurring subscription expenses. Instead of complex budgeting, NudgeFin focuses on a simple, yet powerful 'nudge' mechanism: it scans your transactions for subscriptions, then prompts you with insightful questions to encourage reflection and action, ultimately freeing up money for your financial goals without imposing rigid budget constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Core value proposition</strong></p>
<p>Effortlessly unearths forgotten or underutilized subscriptions, providing personalized 'nudges' that empower users to make informed decisions about their spending. It transforms passive, often unnoticed, recurring expenses into active opportunities for savings and better financial health, without the burden of manual tracking or complex financial planning. It's about finding 'found money' hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p><strong>Target customers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Over-Subscribed Millennial/Gen Z</strong>: Anyone with numerous digital subscriptions (streaming, SaaS, apps, gyms) who struggles to keep track of them all or often forgets about unused services.</li>
<li><strong>The Financially Conscious Newbie</strong>: Individuals who want to improve their financial discipline but find traditional budgeting methods too rigid or time-consuming.</li>
<li><strong>The Opportunity Seeker</strong>: Users looking for simple, actionable ways to save money without drastically changing their lifestyle, focusing on optimizing existing spending.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum viable product (MVP) scope which can be implemented in a day</strong></p>
<p>This MVP is designed to be a sharp, focused tool that delivers immediate value while staying within a single day's development sprint for an indie developer.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Transaction Data Input (Text Area)</strong>: A simple web page with a large text input area. Users can paste raw transaction lines (e.g., copied from a bank statement CSV, or manually typed) into this box. Example: <code>Netflix, 15.99, Monthly; Spotify, 9.99, Monthly; Adobe Creative Cloud, 52.99, Monthly; Local Gym, 35.00, Monthly; Amazon Prime, 14.99, Monthly</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic Subscription Parser</strong>: A lightweight client-side script (JavaScript) that, upon submission, uses basic string matching or regular expressions to identify common subscription keywords (e.g., <code>netflix</code>, <code>spotify</code>, <code>adobe</code>, <code>gym</code>, <code>prime</code>, <code>hulu</code>, <code>microsoft</code>, <code>apple</code>, etc.). For each matched line, it extracts the subscription name and the associated monthly cost.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive 'Nudge' Display</strong>: For each identified subscription, the tool prominently displays:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Subscription Name</strong> and <strong>Monthly Cost</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Three predefined, static 'nudge' questions/prompts</strong> next to it, designed to provoke thought and encourage action. Examples:<ul>
<li>"Is [Subscription Name] still providing indispensable value?"</li>
<li>"When was the last time you actively used [Subscription Name]?"</li>
<li>"Could redirecting [Cost] to your savings goals make a bigger impact?"</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple 'Actioned' Toggle</strong>: Next to each subscription and its nudges, a toggle button (e.g., "I've reviewed this" or a checkbox). Clicking it simply changes the visual state of that item (e.g., greys it out, marks it with a check) within the current session, indicating the user has acknowledged or acted on that particular nudge. No persistent storage is needed for the MVP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Total Monthly Spend Summary</strong>: At the top, a clear, running total showing "You are currently spending ~$X/month on Y identified subscriptions. Take action now to optimize your cash flow!"</p></li>
