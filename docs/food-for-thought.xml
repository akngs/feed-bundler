<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>Many people struggle with maintaining consistency in their goals, whether it's daily coding, learning a new language, regular exercise, or creative writing. "AI Nudge Coach" is a micro-SaaS application that leverages AI to provide personalized, context-aware nudges, combined with subtle gamification, to help users build and sustain consistent habits towards any chosen goal. It acts as a gentle, intelligent accountability partner, designed to make the journey of self-improvement less daunting and more engaging.</p>

By offering highly personalized, AI-generated motivation and tactical advice precisely when needed, paired with simple gamified progress tracking, users overcome inertia and procrastination. The core value is sustained effort, leading to tangible achievement and increased self-efficacy in any desired area.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aspiring Creators & Learners:</strong> Indie developers, writers, artists, musicians, or students striving for consistent daily practice or project completion.</li>
<li><strong>Health & Wellness Enthusiasts:</strong> Individuals aiming for consistent exercise routines, meditation, or dietary habits.</li>
<li><strong>Professionals Seeking Habit Mastery:</strong> Anyone looking to build consistent deep work blocks, professional development routines, or effective daily planning.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Productivity App Users:</strong> People who use habit trackers but often quit because they lack ongoing, personalized motivation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implement-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implement in a Day)</h3>
<p>This MVP focuses on the absolute core loop: define goal, log action, receive AI feedback, see simple progress. Designed for a single user, relying heavily on local storage and an LLM API.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Goal Input (UI):</strong> A single text input field where the user enters one primary consistency goal (e.g., "Write for 30 minutes daily," "Code for 1 hour," "Run 5k").</li>
<li><strong>Action Logging (UI):</strong> Two prominent buttons:<ul>
<li>"I did it today!" – Marks the goal as achieved for the current day.</li>
<li>"I missed today." – Marks the goal as missed.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Basic Gamification (UI):</strong> A simple text display showing the current "Streak: X days" and "Total Successful Days: Y". This data is stored in the user's browser's local storage.</li>
<li><strong>AI Nudge Generation (Backend/API):</strong><ul>
<li>Upon clicking "I did it today!": Trigger an API call to a large language model (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) with a prompt like: "You are an encouraging consistency coach. The user's goal is '[USER_GOAL_FROM_INPUT]'. They just completed it. Give them a short, personalized, positive, and motivating nudge for maintaining their streak. Limit to 50 words."</li>
<li>Upon clicking "I missed today.": Trigger an API call to the LLM with a prompt like: "You are an empathetic consistency coach. The user's goal is '[USER_GOAL_FROM_INPUT]'. They missed it today. Give them a short, understanding, and gently encouraging nudge to get back on track tomorrow. Limit to 50 words."</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Nudge Display (UI):</strong> The AI-generated nudge is displayed prominently on the page after a user logs their daily action.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> All user-specific data (goal, streak, successful days) is stored exclusively in <code>localStorage</code> in the browser, making it a client-side-only experience for the MVP. No server-side database or user authentication is required for this initial version.</li>
