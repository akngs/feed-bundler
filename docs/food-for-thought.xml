<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>Imagine a personal AI coach that understands your learning goals and breaks them down into hyper-focused, gamified micro-challenges you can complete in minutes. This platform isn't just about learning; it's about building, consistently and engagingly. It combats "tutorial hell" by providing actionable, bite-sized tasks tailored to your skill level and available time, turning large projects into a series of achievable wins.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>For indie software developers constantly battling procrastination, context switching, or the overwhelming feeling of starting a new project/technology, the Micro-Project Navigator offers a personalized, gamified path to consistent progress. It transforms daunting goals into delightful daily achievements, keeping you motivated and building momentum through smart nudges and rewarding mini-milestones. Stop <em>planning</em> to learn, start <em>building</em> to learn.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>Indie software developers, aspiring coders, side-project enthusiasts, and anyone struggling to maintain momentum or effectively learn new technologies due to lack of structure, motivation, or clear, actionable next steps. This is for the self-starter who needs a guiding hand to transform ambition into execution.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day)</h3>
<p>To prove the core value proposition, the MVP needs to be razor-sharp and deployable today.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Goal Input Field:</strong> A simple web page with a single text input box: "What do you want to learn or build today?" (e.g., "Learn Rust and build a simple CLI tool," or "Add authentication to my React app using Firebase").</li>
<li><strong>AI Challenge Generation (Proxy Call):</strong> Upon submission, send the user's goal to a large language model API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude). The prompt will instruct the AI to generate 3-5 <em>extremely specific and self-contained coding challenges</em> that can each be completed in under 30 minutes, directly related to the user's input. Crucially, each challenge must have a clear "definition of done."<ul>
<li><em>Example AI Output:</em><ul>
<li>"Challenge 1: Create a new Rust project called <code>cli_tool</code>. In <code>main.rs</code>, print 'Hello, Rust CLI!'"</li>
<li>"Challenge 2: Modify <code>main.rs</code> to accept a command-line argument and print it back, e.g., <code>cargo run -- hello</code> should output 'You said: hello'."</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Display Challenges:</strong> Render the AI-generated challenges as a simple, ordered list on the web page.</li>
<li><strong>Gamified "Done" Button:</strong> Next to each challenge, a "Mark as Complete" button. When clicked, it visually checks off the item (e.g., strikethrough, checkmark icon) and increments a local counter ("Challenges Completed Today: X"). This state is stored purely in browser <code>localStorage</code> – no backend database needed for MVP.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Persistence (via localStorage):</strong> Challenges generated for the day and their completion status persist across browser refresh for that user for the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP demonstrates the personalization (AI-generated tasks), gamification (tracking completion), and core value of breaking down large tasks into manageable, motivating steps. It’s a compelling start, ready for indie developers to build upon.</p>]]></content:encoded>
