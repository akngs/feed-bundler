            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The information overload we face daily is unsustainable. Generic summaries fall short, and sending all our sensitive reading material to cloud AI services raises privacy concerns. The solution lies at the edge.</p>
<h3 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h3>
<p><strong>EdgeLens</strong> is a personalized, local-first AI summarization tool designed to run entirely on the user's device. Leveraging compact AI models and user-defined preferences, it provides instant, tailored summaries of text content (articles, documents, emails) without ever sending data to external servers. Think of it as a smart reading assistant that learns your interests and filters information specifically for <em>you</em>, all while protecting your privacy.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>EdgeLens empowers users to consume information more efficiently and effectively. It drastically reduces reading time by extracting the most relevant details based on their unique, self-defined preferences, offering a truly personalized information feed. The critical differentiator is absolute privacy and control: all processing happens locally, addressing the growing anxieties around data privacy and AI usage.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge Workers & Researchers:</strong> Individuals who process vast amounts of text (reports, papers, legal documents) and need to quickly glean relevant insights.</li>
<li><strong>Students & Academics:</strong> Those sifting through research papers, textbooks, and online articles, seeking key information for learning and assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Content Professionals:</strong> Bloggers, journalists, and marketers who need to rapidly digest industry news and trends.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy-Conscious Users:</strong> Anyone uncomfortable with sending their private correspondence or sensitive documents to cloud-based AI services.</li>
<li><strong>Information Overload Sufferers:</strong> Individuals overwhelmed by the sheer volume of daily digital content.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>The most important aspect here is demonstrating the core value proposition of local, personalized AI <em>today</em>. Here's the absolute MVP:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Local Application Wrapper:</strong> A simple desktop application (e.g., using Electron for cross-platform, or a simple Python/Flask local server accessed via browser) that allows users to input text.</li>
<li><strong>Barebones Local Summarization:</strong> Integrate a pre-trained, <em>very small</em> open-source extractive summarization model (e.g., a highly quantized <code>t5-small</code> or <code>bart-small</code> from Hugging Face, or even a simple TextRank implementation if ML setup is too heavy). Crucially, this model runs entirely on the user's device, requiring no internet connection for summarization.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Personalization Feature:</strong> A text field where the user can input a comma-separated list of</li>
