<p><strong>Brief Description:</strong><br />
A micro-SaaS application designed to help small to medium B2B SaaS companies easily identify customer accounts at risk of churning or sales leads that have gone cold. It does this by analyzing simple, readily available activity data and applying intelligent flagging rules.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition:</strong><br />
Provide actionable, early warning signals for critical customer and lead accounts. Enables proactive engagement to reduce churn, increase retention, and improve sales conversion rates without requiring expensive, complex analytics platforms or dedicated data science resources. Simple, focused, and high ROI.</p>
<p><strong>Target Customers:</strong><br />
Primarily small to medium-sized B2B SaaS companies. This includes roles like Product Managers, Customer Success Managers, Sales Representatives, and founders who need simple, effective tools to monitor their customer and sales pipeline health. Companies who track basic user activity but lack automated systems to act on it.</p>
<p><strong>MVP: One Day Scope</strong><br />
Focus on the most critical and simplest data point: inactivity.</p>
<p>Build a minimal web application with the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CSV Upload Interface:</strong> A simple page where a user can upload a CSV file. Specify the expected columns: <code>account_id</code> (or <code>lead_id</code>) and <code>last_activity_date</code> (in a standard format like YYYY-MM-DD).</li>
<li><strong>Threshold Input:</strong> A simple input field where the user can specify the "inactivity threshold" in days (e.g., 30, 60, 90).</li>
<li><strong>Processing Logic:</strong> On submission, the application reads the CSV. For each row, it compares the <code>last_activity_date</code> to the current date minus the specified threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Results Display:</strong> A simple output page showing a list or table of <code>account_id</code>s (or <code>lead_id</code>s) that are older than the inactivity threshold. These are the "at-risk" accounts flagged by this simple rule.</li>
<li><strong>No Persistence (Initially):</strong> The uploaded data and results are not stored long-term beyond the current session/request processing. Keep it stateless and focused purely on processing the input to output.</li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP, while basic, delivers core value: taking simple, readily available data (CSV export from CRM, analytics tool, or database) and immediately providing a prioritized list of accounts that need human attention. It lays the foundation for adding more sophisticated rules, data sources (webhooks, APIs), and AI models later.</p>]]></content:encoded>
