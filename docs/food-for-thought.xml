            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The modern knowledge worker is drowning in data, constantly shifting context across applications, documents, and discussions. We spend countless hours re-acquiring context, searching for that one crucial detail, or re-tracing our steps. The cognitive load is immense, and privacy concerns loom large when sensitive information is funneled through cloud-based AI.</p>
<p>Imagine an intelligent companion that understands your immediate context—the project you're on, the document you're reading, the code you're debugging—and <em>instantly</em> brings forth the most relevant past notes, related tasks, or key information, all processed locally on your device. No data leaves your machine. No intrusive tracking. Just pure, hyper-contextual assistance.</p>
<p>This is ContextFlow AI: a silent, on-device orchestrator of your personal information flow, designed to make you profoundly more productive by eradicating context decay and information friction at its source.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Brief description of the idea:</strong><br />
A desktop application that runs entirely on your local machine, passively monitoring your active digital workspace (e.g., active window title, open browser tab URL, document path). It leverages local AI heuristics to understand the current context and intelligently surfaces or suggests relevant personal notes, links, and knowledge snippets that you've previously captured, ensuring critical information is always at your fingertips, precisely when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Core value proposition:</strong><br />
Eliminate context-switching friction and information silos by providing instant, privacy-preserving access to your most relevant personal knowledge, directly within your active workspace. Boost productivity, reduce cognitive load, and foster deeper focus by creating a living, self-organizing knowledge graph unique to you.</p>
<p><strong>Target customers:</strong><br />
Indie developers, researchers, writers, consultants, project managers, and any knowledge worker who frequently navigates complex information landscapes across multiple applications and projects, valuing privacy and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope which can be implemented in a day:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>System Tray Application:</strong> A lean, cross-platform (e.g., Electron, Tauri, or native with <code>pyinstaller</code> for Python) application that lives quietly in the system tray/menu bar.</li>
<li><strong>Active Context Monitor:</strong> Basic OS-level APIs to continuously poll and capture the <em>title of the active window</em> and, if it's a browser, the <em>URL of the active tab</em>. (For browsers, this might involve a simple companion extension or relying solely on the window title, which usually includes the page title).</li>
<li><strong>Local Knowledge Base:</strong> A lightweight local database (e.g., SQLite, flat JSON file, <code>localStorage</code> for Electron) to store "notes". Each note comprises:<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: Unique identifier.</li>
<li><code>content</code>: The text of the note.</li>
<li><code>context_fingerprint</code>: A normalized, unique string derived from the window title/URL where the note was taken (e.g., lowercased, common words removed, maybe a simple hash).</li>
<li><code>timestamp</code>: When the note was created/last updated.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>AI-powered Contextual Retrieval (Day 1 version):</strong><ul>
<li>When a new note is added, also extract a few key terms (e.g., using <code>tf-idf</code> on current context and note, or simple frequency analysis after stop-word removal). Store these key terms with the note.</li>
<li>When the active window/tab changes, extract key terms from the new context.</li>
<li><strong>"AI" Match Function:</strong> Compare the <em>current context's key terms</em> against the <em>stored key terms</em> of all past notes. Prioritize notes based on the <em>overlap of key terms</em> (e.g., Jaccard similarity or simple count of shared terms).</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Overlay / Notification for Recall:</strong> When the match function identifies a relevant note (above a simple threshold of term overlap), a small, non-intrusive, dismissible pop-up or system notification appears, displaying the relevant note content.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Note Capture:</strong> A global hotkey or a click on the tray icon to bring up a mini editor. The user can type a note, which is then automatically saved, linking it to the <em>current active context</em> (window title/URL) and generating its <code>context_fingerprint</code> and key terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP establishes the core loop of context monitoring -&gt; AI-assisted recall -&gt; note capture, all locally, laying the foundation for more sophisticated edge AI features like local LLM summarization, task suggestion, and deeper semantic understanding in future iterations.</p>]]></content:encoded>
