It intelligently monitors the operational status of key appliances and systems using existing or easily deployable IoT sensors, applying simple AI rules to identify inefficiencies (e.g., appliances left on overnight) and proactively alert business owners, promoting sustainability through intelligent resource management and cost savings.\n\n### Core Value Proposition\n"Unlock significant cost savings and bolster your eco-friendly image by effortlessly eliminating energy and resource waste. EcoGuard provides smart, actionable insights from your existing infrastructure, ensuring nothing is left unnecessarily 'on' or 'wasting' after hours, without requiring complex integrations or expensive overhauls."\n\n### Target Customers\nIndependent cafes, local retail stores, small offices, boutique workshops, and other small businesses that possess a few smart devices (e.g., smart plugs, smart lights) or are open to low-cost IoT sensor adoption, and are looking for simple, impactful ways to reduce operational costs and enhance their sustainability efforts.\n\n### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)\n\nThe essence of "in a day" is to prove the core intelligence and value proposition, not full-stack deployment.\n\n1.  <strong>Simulated Device Data Endpoint:</strong> Create a barebones backend endpoint (e.g., a simple Python Flask or Node.js Express route) that <em>accepts simulated input</em> for a single "critical appliance" (e.g., a coffee machine or shop sign light). The input should be a JSON object like <code>{"deviceId": "cafe-main-coffee", "status": "on", "timestamp": "2025-07-26T21:00:00Z"}</code>.\n    *   <em>Implementation Trick:</em> For Day 1, this endpoint doesn't need to be integrated with a real IoT hub. You, the developer, can manually <code>POST</code> data to it using <code>curl</code> or a simple web form, simulating a device reporting its status.\n\n2.  <strong>"After-Hours On" Rule Engine:</strong> A simple script or function (part of your backend, running on a cron-like schedule, even every 5 minutes) that executes the core "AI" rule:\n    *   <strong>Rule:</strong> If <code>deviceId</code> "cafe-main-coffee" reports "on" <em>after</em> a predefined "closing time" (e.g., 8 PM hardcoded), trigger an alert.\n    *   <em>Sustainability Link:</em> This directly addresses energy waste from appliances left on overnight.\n\n3.  <strong>Basic Alerting:</strong> If the "after-hours on" rule triggers, send a simple email notification to a <em>single, hardcoded recipient</em> (e.g., your own email address). The email content can be as simple as "Alert: Cafe Main Coffee Machine is ON after closing time!"\n\n<strong>Why this is a "Day MVP":</strong>\n*   <strong>No user management:</strong> Authentication, onboarding, billing are skipped.\n*   <strong>No complex UI:</strong> A simple console output or basic HTML page confirming data receipt/alert status is sufficient.\n*   <strong>Simulated IoT:</strong> The hardest part of IoT (device integration) is <em>mocked</em> by manual data input, proving the <em>intelligence</em> layer is possible.\n*   <strong>Single Rule, Single Device:</strong> Hyper-focused on one high-impact use case.\n\nThis MVP demonstrates the core "AI for sustainability via IoT data" loop, providing tangible proof of concept for the idea's potential. It sets the stage for adding real IoT integrations, more complex rules, and user features in subsequent iterations.</h3>]]></content:encoded>
