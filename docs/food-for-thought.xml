            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p><strong>AmbiFocus</strong> is a minimalist desktop application designed to combat digital fatigue and improve sustained focus through a novel, non-intrusive human-computer interface (HCI). It passively monitors a user's digital activity patterns and, utilizing subtle, ambient audio cues, gently prompts for micro-breaks or a shift in cognitive state, preventing burnout before it takes hold. The ultimate vision is an AI that learns individual work rhythms and adapts its nudges for optimal cognitive well-being.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>AmbiFocus enhances digital well-being and productivity by proactively mitigating cognitive overload and fostering healthier work habits. Unlike intrusive notifications, it delivers gentle, adaptive interventions that integrate seamlessly into the user's workflow, without requiring active attention or disrupting flow states. It’s an ambient guardian for your mental clarity.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>This tool is ideal for knowledge workers, indie software developers, writers, designers, students, and anyone who spends extended periods focused on a computer screen and struggles with digital fatigue, context switching, or maintaining healthy work-break cycles.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope: Implementable in a Day</h3>
<p>To build AmbiFocus in a single day, focus on the absolute core loop: passive monitoring and ambient cueing.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Platform & Basic Structure:</strong> Create a simple desktop application. An Electron app or a Python script with <code>pynput</code> and <code>playsound</code> would work. The app should have a basic interface (e.g., a system tray icon or a tiny, dismissible window) with just a "Start" and "Stop" button.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Passive Activity Monitoring:</strong> Implement a background process that monitors keyboard and mouse activity. This can be as simple as tracking the timestamp of the last input event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple Trigger Logic:</strong> Define a hardcoded time threshold for continuous activity. For instance, if no significant pause in keyboard/mouse input has occurred for 25 minutes, trigger a nudge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ambient Audio Cue (The New HCI):</strong> When the trigger condition is met, play a single, very short (e.g., 0.5 - 1 second), pleasant, and <em>non-alarming</em> audio file through the system's default audio output. This should be a subtle, ambient sound – think a gentle chime, a soft synth pad, or a distant forest sound – specifically chosen <em>not</em> to startle or demand immediate attention, but rather to exist on the periphery of perception. The sound file is pre-selected and bundled with the MVP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Settings (MVP):</strong> For the MVP, there are no configurable settings for thresholds, sounds, or AI learning. The focus is purely on demonstrating the core ambient intervention concept. The "AI" aspect is currently the <em>problem identification</em> (detecting long work periods) which hints at future adaptive personalization, but the intelligence itself is rudimentary (a simple timer).</p></li>
