<p>Alright team, listen up. Forget chasing broad trends. The real money for indie devs often lies in solving acute, specific pain points within micro-niches. Finding these requires digging, often in dusty corners of the internet. But manual digging is slow, soul-crushing, and inefficient.</p>
<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>An automated tool that leverages cloud computing and basic AI/ML techniques to analyze online discussions (starting with specific platforms) to uncover recurring problems, unanswered questions, and unmet needs within a user-defined niche or related to a specific keyword.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Provides indie developers with actionable, data-driven insights into real-world problems people are facing <em>right now</em> in potential product areas. This accelerates market validation, helps prioritize features, and sparks new product ideas, saving countless hours of manual research.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>Indie software developers, solo founders, micro-SaaS builders, content creators, and anyone looking to identify specific problems to solve with a product or service.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>Okay, let's build something functional <em>today</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple Interface:</strong> A dead-simple web page with two input fields: "Keyword/Topic" and "Source Identifier" (start with a specific public data source, e.g., just one popular subreddit name like <code>r/buildaproduct</code> or <code>r/selfhosted</code>). A submit button.</li>
<li><strong>Backend Script (Python):</strong> A simple script running on a cloud function (like AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, or Google Cloud Functions) or a tiny VPS.</li>
<li><strong>Data Fetching:</strong> Use a library (e.g., <code>praw</code> for Reddit, adhering strictly to API terms and rate limits) to fetch recent posts and comments related to the <code>Keyword/Topic</code> from the specified <code>Source Identifier</code> (e.g., search within the chosen subreddit).</li>
<li><strong>Minimalist "AI" Processing:</strong> This is where the magic starts, albeit basic for day one. Instead of complex NLP, perform two simple computational steps on the text collected (specifically comment bodies):<ul>
<li>Filter sentences containing the <code>Keyword/Topic</code> AND basic problem indicators (e.g., regex for "problem with", "bug in", "error", "struggling with", "how to", sentences ending in <code>?</code>).</li>
<li>Apply a basic frequency count or TF-IDF (using a library like <code>scikit-learn</code> if easily integrated without heavy dependencies) on the <em>filtered sentences</em> to identify the most common recurring <em>terms</em> mentioned within those problem discussions.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Basic Output:</strong> A results page displaying:<ul>
<li>A simple list of the top N most frequent terms identified in the problem-oriented sentences.</li>
<li>A few raw examples of the filtered sentences/comment snippets themselves, showing the context of the pain points.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP demonstrates the core loop: get user topic/source -&gt; fetch relevant data -&gt; apply simple computational analysis to identify patterns/problems -&gt; display results. It's raw, limited, but provides concrete value and is 100% achievable for a focused indie dev in a single day.</p>]]></content:encoded>
