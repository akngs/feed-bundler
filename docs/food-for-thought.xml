            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indie software developers, especially those venturing into XR, often grapple with vast, interconnected ideas that traditional linear notes fail to capture effectively. Imagine a knowledge base where your thoughts aren't confined to lists or folders but exist in a navigable, spatial arrangement, much like a "memory palace." This is the essence of <strong>Contextual Memory Maps</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Description of the Idea:</strong><br />
Contextual Memory Maps is a personal knowledge management system that reimagines the wiki. Instead of purely text-based entries, it uses a visual, spatial canvas where "knowledge nodes" (text snippets, links, code blocks) are placed and organized intuitively. AI assists in identifying connections, suggesting relevant information based on spatial proximity or semantic similarity, and enabling a unique "spatial recall" for complex ideas. The XR component comes from fostering spatial thinking and serving as an ideal conceptual playground for XR projects.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Conceptualization:</strong> Leverage your innate spatial memory to organize and retrieve complex, interlinked ideas, especially beneficial for multi-dimensional concepts common in XR.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond Linear Notes:</strong> Break free from flat lists; create dynamic, interconnected knowledge landscapes that mirror your thought processes.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Discovery:</strong> AI acts as a silent co-pilot, helping you find forgotten connections and rediscover knowledge based on context and spatial relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Target Customers:</strong><br />
Independent XR developers, game designers, architects, digital artists, researchers, and anyone who thrives on interconnected ideas and benefits from a visual, spatially organized approach to information. Specifically tailored for creators building in or thinking about spatial computing.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day):</strong><br />
Your goal for day one is to create a rudimentary web-based prototype demonstrating the core spatial and linking concepts, with a <em>hint</em> of AI potential.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interactive 2D Canvas (Web):</strong> A simple HTML canvas or SVG-based interactive board.</li>
<li><strong>Drag-and-Drop Nodes:</strong> Users can click anywhere to create a new rectangular "knowledge node." Each node has a resizable text input area. Nodes can be freely dragged and positioned on the canvas. Basic delete functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Basic "Wiki" Linking:</strong> Implement <code>[[Internal Link]]</code> syntax within any node's text. Clicking on a linked text segment will visually highlight or smoothly navigate the canvas to an existing node with that exact title. If no such node exists, a new, empty node with that title is automatically created, ready for content.</li>
<li><strong>"Smart Recall" Button (Simulated AI):</strong> A prominent button (e.g., "Find Related Ideas"). When clicked, it performs a simple keyword search across <em>all node contents</em> (case-insensitive). It then visually highlights all nodes that contain any words from the currently selected node, <em>simulating</em> an AI's ability to identify relevant connections.</li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP immediately provides a powerful, non-linear thinking tool, setting the stage for future AI-powered spatial interactions within the realm of XR concepts.</p>]]></content:encoded>
