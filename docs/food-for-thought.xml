Journalists spend countless hours manually sifting through public records—city council minutes, police reports, property deeds—just to get the basic facts. This administrative burden often prevents deeper investigative work and timely reporting, leaving communities less informed. This is where AI, coupled with an API-first approach, offers a profound solution.\n\n### Brief Description of the Idea\nImagine an API endpoint that, given a URL to a public document (e.g., city council meeting minutes, local government budget, police blotter), can rapidly extract key decisions, factual data points, stakeholder names, and even flag potential inconsistencies. This 'Hyperlocal Fact-Engine' would be a subscription-based AI service empowering local journalists to automate their initial research, fact-gathering, and data extraction processes, freeing them to focus on analysis, context, and storytelling.\n\n### Core Value Proposition\n<strong>Time & Resource Multiplier:</strong> Significantly reduces the manual labor involved in early-stage journalistic research, allowing journalists to produce more stories, conduct deeper investigations, and meet tighter deadlines. It democratizes access to advanced research capabilities typically only available to larger news organizations, leveling the playing field for independent and small-town newsrooms.\n\n### Target Customers\n*   <strong>Independent Local Journalists:</strong> Often working solo or in small teams, they desperately need tools to scale their impact.\n*   <strong>Small & Medium-Sized Local Newsrooms:</strong> News outlets with limited staff and budget looking to optimize workflows.\n*   <strong>Hyperlocal Bloggers & Citizen Journalism Initiatives:</strong> Groups focused on factual, community-driven reporting but lacking research infrastructure.\n*   <strong>Investigative Journalism Non-Profits:</strong> Seeking efficiencies in data collection for local probes.\n\n### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope: Implementable in a Day\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a highly focused API that solves <em>one</em> immediate pain point for a journalist. \n\n<strong>MVP Focus: Extracting Key Decisions from City Council Meeting Minutes</strong>\n\n1.  <strong>Simple API Endpoint:</strong> Create a <code>POST</code> endpoint (e.g., <code>/api/extract-minutes</code>) that accepts a JSON payload containing a single field: <code>url</code> (e.g., <code>{\"url\": \"https://www.cityofanytown.gov/council_minutes/2025-09-28.pdf\"}</code>).\n2.  <strong>Document Ingestion:</strong> Use a library (e.g., <code>requests</code> + <code>PyPDF2</code>/<code>pdfminer.six</code> for Python, or a similar Node.js/Rust stack) to fetch the content from the provided URL. Focus initially on one format (e.g., PDF) or even just plain HTML. Your MVP can initially target public records from a <em>single, specific local government's website</em> (e.g., City of Anytown, State College Borough). This sharply limits your parsing complexity.\n3.  <strong>AI Extraction via LLM:</strong> Feed the raw text content to an advanced Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or even a fine-tuned open-source model like Llama 3). Your prompt should instruct the LLM to:\n    *   Identify and list distinct agenda items or motions discussed.\n    *   For each item, extract the <strong>key decision(s) made</strong> (e.g., \"Resolution A-24-12 approved\").\n    *   Identify any <strong>monetary figures</strong> directly associated with a decision.\n    *   List <strong>names of individuals</strong> making, seconding, or voting on critical motions.\n    *   Output this information in a structured JSON format.\n4.  <strong>JSON Response:</strong> The API should return a structured JSON response (e.g., <code>{\"meeting_date\": \"2025-09-28\", \"decisions\": [{\"item\": \"Road Repair Budget\", \"decision\": \"Approved $5M for Phase 1\", \"involved_parties\": [\"Councilor Smith\"]}]}</code>).\n\nThis focused MVP, built in a day, proves the core concept. It provides immediate, tangible value by transforming unstructured public data into actionable, structured information for local journalists. The API economy potential is clear: charge per query, per document, or via tiered subscriptions. Go forth and empower the truth-tellers!</h1>]]></content:encoded>
