            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today's innovation isn't about building <em>another</em> Wikipedia, but about making <em>hyper-specialized, AI-curated knowledge</em> accessible and monetizable. We call it <strong>"AI-Curated Niche Knowledge APIs."</strong></p>
<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>Imagine building a knowledge base not through countless human edits, but by intelligently curating and structuring information from highly specific, often unstructured, data sources within niche domains. This platform leverages AI to digest, summarize, and extract relationships from complex textual data (e.g., obscure game lore forums, academic papers on specific fungi species, technical specifications of vintage electronics), then exposes this refined, clean data as a commercial API. It's a "wiki" where the AI is a primary contributor, ensuring depth, accuracy, and structured output on topics too narrow for general platforms.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>For domain experts and communities, it transforms scattered, overwhelming information into a highly organized, searchable, and AI-verifiable knowledge hub. For developers, it provides programmatic access to specialized, clean, and pre-processed data that is otherwise impossible or prohibitively expensive to collect and curate. It democratizes access to expert-level information, enabling new applications, research tools, and content generation in underserved niches.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Niche Hobbyists & Enthusiasts:</strong> Communities deeply invested in specific, detailed topics (e.g., collectors of obscure vintage hardware, dedicated players of niche tabletop RPGs, local history buffs) who struggle to organize and share their vast knowledge effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Specialized Software Developers & AI Engineers:</strong> Building applications, chatbots, or research tools that require granular, accurate, and structured data on very specific, long-tail subjects where general-purpose knowledge bases fall short.</li>
<li><strong>Content Creators & Researchers:</strong> Requiring quick, verifiable, and structured factual information for their articles, videos, or academic work in hyper-focused areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>Your goal for Day 1 is to demonstrate the core value: AI structuring niche data and serving it via API. Forget user accounts, fancy UIs, or collaborative editing. This is a backend-focused MVP.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single, Hyper-Niche Focus:</strong> Choose one <em>extremely</em> narrow niche. For example: "Key Characters from the Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, specifically from the Tribunal expansion" or "Historical uses of a single, rare mineral." The narrower, the better for Day 1.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Seed Data & AI Processing Script:</strong> Manually input (copy-paste) 2-3 paragraphs of raw, unstructured text related to your chosen niche into a backend script or a simple text file. This will be your "wiki content" source. Your script, upon execution, will feed this text to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) with a prompt like: "Extract all key entities, their attributes (e.g., name, role, powers, affiliations), and relationships (e.g., 'X is allied with Y') from the following text and output as JSON."</li>
<li><strong>Single API Endpoint:</strong> Create a bare-bones REST API endpoint (e.g., <code>/api/v1/niche_data?query=entity_name</code>) using a microframework like Flask or Express. This endpoint will accept a <code>query</code> parameter (e.g., a character's name). It will then query your previously AI-processed, structured data (which you'll cache in memory or a simple flat file for Day 1) and return relevant facts about that entity in JSON format. The "wiki" is in the structured output; the "API economy" is the exposed endpoint; the "AI" is the processing engine.</li>
<li><strong>No Public UI (Optional Minimal Demo UI):</strong> For your personal testing, a very simple HTML page with a single text input and a button that calls your API and displays the raw JSON response is sufficient. This is purely for internal validation that the API works. The focus is <em>purely</em> on the AI + API backend.</li>
