<p><strong>Brief Description:</strong><br />
Project Pulse AI is a lean, AI-powered assistant designed for small B2B service providers to gain immediate, actionable insights from unstructured client communications. It acts as a 'second brain,' distilling lengthy emails, chat logs, or meeting notes into crystal-clear action items, commitments, and sentiment analyses, ensuring no critical detail is missed and client relationships are proactively managed.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition:</strong><br />

Project Pulse AI translates communication chaos into actionable clarity, reducing missed deadlines, preventing miscommunications, and fostering stronger client satisfaction by ensuring every commitment is tracked and understood.</p>
<p><strong>Target Customers:</strong><br />
Independent consultants, freelance professionals, boutique agencies (marketing, design, web development), B2B SaaS companies offering implementation or custom services, and any small business serving other businesses directly where client communication volume is high and dedicated project management resources are scarce. Think of the 1-10 person team that needs to stay on top of multiple client engagements simultaneously.</p>

<li><strong>Text Input:</strong> Users can paste raw text content from any client communication (e.g., an email thread, Slack conversation export, meeting notes, project brief). The system should only accept text input â€“ no file uploads, no integrations (yet!).</li>
<li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> When the user clicks a</li>
