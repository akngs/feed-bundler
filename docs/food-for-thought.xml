<p>Welcome, indie developers. Let's talk about leveraging three massive trends: AI, SaaS, and Gamification. The idea is simple, solves a real problem, and has an MVP you can ship <em>today</em>.</p>
<h2 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h2>
<p>PromptQuest is a SaaS platform designed to help individuals and teams master the art of communicating with AI models. Users practice writing prompts for various scenarios (text generation, image creation, coding assistance, etc.) within a gamified environment. The platform provides structured challenges, feedback (eventually AI-powered), points, levels, and leaderboards to make learning effective prompting skills engaging and fun.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Improve your AI prompting skills, unlock the full potential of AI tools, and stay ahead in an AI-driven world, all through an interactive, engaging, and measurable gamified experience.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Individuals who frequently use AI tools for work or creative projects (marketers, writers, designers, developers, students).</li>
<li>Businesses looking to train their employees on effective AI usage to boost productivity.</li>
<li>Educators and trainers teaching AI skills.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>Let's get this live. <em>Forget real AI evaluation or complex gamification for Day 1</em>. Focus on the core loop:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple Web Interface:</strong> A single page with a title ("PromptQuest MVP").</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Selection:</strong> A dropdown or heading indicating a single, hardcoded</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>
