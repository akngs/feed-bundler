<h2 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h2>
<p>Many dating apps focus on finding similarities. This often leads to superficial connections and wasted time on first dates that reveal fundamental incompatibilities. "Predictive Relationship Friction Analyst" is a tool that shifts the focus from finding <em>common ground</em> to proactively <em>identifying potential deal-breakers</em> and deep-seated lifestyle misalignments <em>before</em> significant time and emotional energy are invested. It empowers users to define their non-negotiable personal and lifestyle requirements, then leverages AI and predictive analytics to screen prospective matches for high-probability friction points that might otherwise go unnoticed until much later.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>To save daters invaluable time and emotional energy by providing immediate, actionable insights into potential fundamental incompatibilities with prospective matches. Users can quickly filter out profiles that are highly likely to lead to long-term friction, even if they initially appear compatible on the surface.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<p>Individuals actively dating on any platform (apps, social groups, etc.) who are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time-poor professionals</strong> looking for efficiency in their dating journey.</li>
<li><strong>Serious daters</strong> seeking long-term compatibility beyond superficial interests.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals with specific lifestyle requirements</strong> (e.g., non-negotiable routines, unique hobbies, family plans) who struggle to convey or find alignment for these in standard profiles.</li>
<li><strong>People tired of repetitive, unsuccessful first dates</strong> due to unforeseen incompatibilities.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>The goal is to provide immediate, tangible value with minimal complexity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>User Input Form:</strong> A simple web page with two text areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Dealbreakers/Non-Negotiables:</strong> A multi-line text input where the user lists 3-5 concise, high-priority personal and lifestyle requirements. Examples: "Absolutely no desire for children," "Needs quiet evenings for reading," "Must be a morning person," "Values strict financial planning."</li>
<li><strong>Match's Profile/Bio Text:</strong> A multi-line text input where the user pastes the full text from a prospective match's dating app profile, bio, or initial chat snippet.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>"Analyze Potential Friction" Button:</strong> A single button that, when clicked, triggers an API call.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Serverless/Simple Backend Logic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take the two user inputs.</li>
<li>Construct a prompt for a large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or similar, or even a local open-source LLM if the dev prefers).</li>
<li><strong>Example Prompt:</strong> "Given the user's non-negotiable preferences/dealbreakers: '{dealbreakers_text}', and this potential match's profile text: '{profile_text}', identify any specific, likely friction points or direct contradictions. Focus on the core differences that could cause long-term incompatibility. Be concise, using bullet points for identified points."</li>
<li>Send the prompt to the LLM and receive its response.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Display Results:</strong> Present the LLM's raw textual output directly below the inputs. No fancy scoring, just the identified friction points as the LLM states them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP leverages an existing LLM's intelligence to perform the core predictive analysis, keeping the indie developer's scope to front-end capture, API integration, and basic display. The value is immediately apparent: real-time, personalized deal-breaker identification.</p>]]></content:encoded>
