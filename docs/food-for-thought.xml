<h2 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h2>
<p>In remote work environments, critical information, decisions, and discussions often get buried across myriad asynchronous channels: Slack threads, Teams chats, Notion comments, Jira descriptions, and email chains. This distributed knowledge creates significant overhead, leading to redundant questions, context switching, and slower onboarding for new team members. The <strong>Contextual Knowledge Query API</strong> offers a solution: an AI-powered service that transforms these scattered communications into a queryable knowledge base. Teams can feed their unstructured communication data into the API, then query it to instantly retrieve answers, summarize key points, and locate specific discussions, all through a simple programmatic interface.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>This service drastically reduces the time and cognitive load associated with information retrieval in remote teams. It turns chaotic, ephemeral communication into an organized, instantly queryable knowledge asset. By centralizing and intelligentizing access to fragmented information, it boosts productivity, enhances decision-making speed, and significantly eases the burden of onboarding new hires by making tribal knowledge accessible on demand. It shifts the paradigm from endless searching to direct questioning.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote-first Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs):</strong> Particularly those scaling rapidly and experiencing information overload.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Teams:</strong> Struggling with fragmented technical discussions and decision logs across various tools.</li>
<li><strong>Product Teams:</strong> Needing to quickly recall user feedback, design decisions, and sprint outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Project Managers & Team Leads:</strong> Seeking to efficiently track progress, blockers, and resolved issues without manual sifting.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Assistants & Knowledge Workers:</strong> Tasked with synthesizing information from disparate sources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>The brilliance of this idea for an indie developer lies in its tight MVP, focusing solely on the core value proposition. You can launch a demonstrable, valuable prototype within a single day.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Simple Ingestion Endpoint (<code>POST /upload</code>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a single HTTP POST endpoint that accepts a <code>multipart/form-data</code> request containing one <code>.txt</code> or <code>.md</code> file. This file represents a raw dump of communication (e.g., a Slack channel export, copied-pasted meeting notes, a lengthy email thread).</li>
<li><strong>Crucial constraint:</strong> For the 1-day MVP, <em>do not persist user data</em>. Process it in memory. If a simple session mechanism is needed (e.g., a <code>session_id</code> returned on upload), store it ephemerally for a very short duration (e.g., 5-10 minutes) in a dictionary or in-memory cache.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Internal AI Processing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon file upload, immediately send the text content to a readily available commercial Large Language Model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini). The LLM will perform the embedding and initial context understanding. Your server acts as a thin wrapper.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Query Endpoint (<code>POST /query</code>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create another HTTP POST endpoint that accepts a JSON body with a <code>question</code> string and optionally a <code>session_id</code> (if implementing ephemeral context linking).</li>
<li><strong>Logic:</strong> Use the <code>question</code> and the recently processed text from the <code>session_id</code> (or the last uploaded file if no sessions) to construct a prompt for the chosen LLM API. The LLM will then generate an answer based <em>only</em> on the provided text context.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>/query</code> endpoint returns the AI-generated answer as a plain text or JSON response. </li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>No User Accounts / Authentication (Initially):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Skip user registration and authentication for the 1-day MVP. The focus is on functionality. You can hardcode a single API key or make it open for a brief demo period. </li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal Tech Stack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A simple web framework (e.g., Python's FastAPI/Flask, Node.js Express) with a library for HTTP requests to external LLM APIs (e.g., <code>requests</code> in Python, <code>axios</code> in Node.js).</li>
<li>This setup validates the core</li></ul></li>
