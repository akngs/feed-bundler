            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright team, listen up. This year, we're leaning into the intersection of AI, B2C, and the inherent human desire to play and create. The market is flooded with complex AI tools and elaborate games. We're going minimalist, impactful.</p>
<p><strong>The Idea: Daily Spark</strong></p>
<p>Forget building the next complex game engine or a general-purpose AI assistant. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a wellspring of daily imagination. A simple service that delivers a unique, AI-generated creative prompt to its users every single day. This prompt isn't a game <em>in itself</em>, but it's the seed for countless games, drawings, stories, and discussions.</p>
<p>Imagine: waking up and getting a prompt like "Draw the sound of a forgotten memory," "Describe a conversation between two colors," or "Design a vending machine for emotions." These aren't straightforward instructions; they're evocative, slightly bizarre, and designed to kickstart creativity.</p>
<p><strong>Core Value Proposition</strong></p>
<p>In a world of infinite content, curated constraint can be incredibly valuable. Daily Spark offers a small, delightful moment of creative ignition. It's a simple routine that encourages imagination, combats creative block, and provides a shared focal point for communities (drawing challenges, writing groups, even just friends sharing what they came up with).</p>
<p>It's not about the complexity of the output, but the consistent <em>novelty</em> and the push towards original thought, delivered in a clean, user-friendly way.</p>
<p><strong>Target Customers</strong></p>
<p>Think broader than just hardcore artists or writers. Our target is anyone who enjoys a creative outlet or is looking for simple ways to spark their imagination: casual artists, hobbyist writers, people in online creative communities, teachers looking for lesson starters, game masters needing session hooks, or just individuals who appreciate a daily dose of weird, interesting inspiration.</p>
<p>It's B2C, yes, but the 'C' is anyone open to a little daily wonder.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope: Implementable in a Day</strong></p>
<p>This is key. Your V1 is <em>just</em> the core engine and display. In one day, you should be able to build this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A single, public web page.</strong> No user accounts, no databases (initially). Just one page everyone sees.</li>
<li><strong>A clear area displaying text.</strong> This is where the prompt goes.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with an AI API.</strong> Use a service like OpenAI, Anthropic, or even a more niche generative text model provider.</li>
<li><strong>A backend script or simple handler.</strong> This script does <em>one</em> thing: call the AI API with a predefined, carefully crafted prompt (e.g., "Generate a unique, surreal, and inspiring creative prompt for drawing or writing. Make it brief and evocative."). It then displays the AI's response on the web page.</li>
<li><strong>Automated or manual regeneration.</strong> For a true "daily" prompt, you'd set up a cron job or scheduler to refresh the prompt once every 24 hours. <em>For the 1-day MVP</em>, you can even just have a button that triggers the generation on demand, or simply regenerate it manually once for testing. The core is generating <em>a</em> prompt and displaying it.</li>
<li><strong>Simple copy button.</strong> Add a button to easily copy the prompt to the user's clipboard.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. A page that, when loaded (or button clicked), hits an AI, gets a unique prompt, and displays it. No elaborate UI, no sharing features, no galleries. Just the source of the spark.</p>
<p>This MVP is entirely feasible within a day's focused work for an indie developer. It proves the core concept: Can I reliably generate interesting prompts? Can I display them? Everything else is iteration. Go build.</p>]]></content:encoded>
