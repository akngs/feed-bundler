<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>This idea proposes a minimalist, AI-powered web tool designed to act as an "extended cognition" aid for qualitative researchers. Its core function is to rapidly process raw interview transcripts or notes, offloading the labor-intensive initial phase of identifying emergent themes and summaries. Instead of manual highlighting and note-taking across dozens of documents, the AI provides an instant, digestible summary, freeing up the researcher's mental capacity for deeper interpretation and strategic analysis.</p>
<h2 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Qualitative research, while invaluable, is cognitively demanding and time-consuming, particularly in the synthesis phase. This tool dramatically reduces the time and mental fatigue associated with early-stage qualitative data analysis (e.g., identifying initial themes from interview notes). It allows researchers to move past the tedious data compilation into higher-level thinking, thereby accelerating insight generation and improving the overall efficiency and quality of user research efforts. It's not about replacing human insight but augmenting it.</p>
<h2 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>UX Researchers:</strong> Individuals or small teams conducting user interviews, usability studies, and ethnographic research.</li>
<li><strong>Product Managers/Designers:</strong> Those who occasionally conduct informal user interviews but lack specialized research tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Researchers:</strong> Students and faculty in social sciences, humanities, or design fields dealing with interview data.</li>
<li><strong>Market Researchers:</strong> Professionals analyzing qualitative feedback from focus groups or in-depth interviews.</li>
<li><strong>Indie Developers & Founders:</strong> Building their first products and talking to early customers, needing quick synthesis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h2>
<p>The goal is to demonstrate the core value with absolute minimal effort, allowing for immediate feedback and iteration.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple Web Interface:</strong> A single web page with a large, plain text area.</li>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Users paste raw, unformatted interview transcript text or bullet-point notes into the text area.</li>
<li><strong>Process Button:</strong> A clear button (e.g., "Analyze Notes," "Get Themes").</li>
<li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> On button click, the pasted text is sent directly to a publicly available LLM API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The prompt should instruct the LLM to:<ul>
<li>"Identify 3-5 core themes from the following user interview notes."</li>
<li>"For each theme, provide a one-sentence summary and extract 1-2 direct quotes or paraphrases from the notes that exemplify it."</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Output Display:</strong> The LLM's response is displayed directly below the input text area, as plain text, within the same page.</li>
<li><strong>No Persistency:</strong> No user accounts, no saving of inputs or outputs. It's a "fire-and-forget" utility.</li>
<li><strong>No Advanced Features:</strong> No file uploads, no multiple interviews, no editing, no sophisticated UI. Just the raw cognitive offload.</li>
</ol>
<p>This "single-day" MVP proves the concept of AI as a cognitive assistant for qualitative synthesis. It delivers immediate, tangible value by taking a messy input and providing structured, initial themes, paving the way for further development like user accounts, project management, advanced analysis (sentiment, specific entities), and integration with other research tools.</p>]]></content:encoded>
