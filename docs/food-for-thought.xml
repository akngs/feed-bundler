            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>"The Socratic AI Debugger" is an AI-powered tool designed to serve as a focused thought partner for indie software developers. It guides users through their coding or conceptual challenges by asking precise, Socratic questions, forcing a deeper articulation of the problem. Beyond self-help, it assists in crystallizing complex issues into clear, concise problem statements, making them ready for effective human collaboration when external help is eventually needed.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>This tool drastically reduces "stuck" time by enabling self-guided problem resolution, acting as an unbiased mental sparring partner. It enhances independent debugging skills and, critically, transforms vague frustrations into well-defined problem descriptions. This structure saves invaluable time for both the individual and potential collaborators, making peer assistance requests more efficient and targeted.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>Indie software developers, solo founders, remote developers, and members of small development teams. Anyone who frequently finds themselves wrestling with complex bugs, architectural dilemmas, or conceptual blocks without immediate access to a senior mentor or dedicated peer support.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope</h3>
<p>An MVP implementable in a single day would focus on the core Socratic interaction and the immediate output:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple Web Interface:</strong> A single HTML page with a large, intuitive text input area labeled "Describe your problem or idea hereâ€¦". Below it, a single button: "Think with AI".</li>
<li><strong>AI Orchestration (Backend):</strong> A lightweight serverless function (e.g., using Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, or a simple Flask/Node.js endpoint) that receives the user's input.</li>
<li><strong>Socratic Prompt Engineering:</strong> This function makes an API call (e.g., to OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4) with the user's problem. The critical component is the system prompt: "You are a Socratic AI Debugger. Your role is to help developers articulate their problems and guide them towards solutions by asking clarifying, probing questions. Do not give direct answers unless asked. Focus on breaking down the problem, identifying assumptions, clarifying goals, and understanding the user's current mental model. After each question, provide a concise 'Current Problem Statement Draft' based <em>only</em> on the information shared so far, which the user can refine or use for collaboration."</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Output Display:</strong> The AI's generated Socratic question and the "Current Problem Statement Draft" are displayed directly below the input area. The input area's content is cleared for the next iteration.</li>
<li><strong>No Persistence/Accounts:</strong> No user accounts, no session history, no database. Each interaction is a fresh start, ensuring the fastest possible deployment and reducing scope creep. The user can copy/paste their previous input to continue a conversation if desired.</li>
</ol>
<p>This MVP delivers immediate value for self-help and provides a tangible output for structured collaboration preparation, all within a day's work for a competent indie dev.</p>]]></content:encoded>
