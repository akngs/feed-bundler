It leverages basic AI/statistical techniques to monitor daily cloud spending, identify unusual anomalies (e.g., a forgotten resource, a misconfiguration, or an unexpected usage surge), and send proactive alerts directly to your inbox before a minor issue becomes a major bill.\n\n## Core Value Proposition\nPeace of mind and significant cost savings. SMBs and individual developers often lack the dedicated FinOps teams of larger enterprises, making them vulnerable to runaway cloud expenses. Cloud Bill Sentinel acts as an autonomous financial watchdog, preventing bill shock by flagging anomalous spending patterns early, allowing users to take corrective action promptly.\n\n## Target Customers\n*   <strong>Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs):</strong> Companies utilizing public cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) without dedicated financial operations or DevOps teams.\n*   <strong>Startups:</strong> Lean teams focused on product development, needing simple, set-and-forget cost oversight.\n*   <strong>Individual Developers:</strong> Freelancers or independent consultants managing their own cloud infrastructure, highly sensitive to unexpected infrastructure costs.\n\n## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a day)\n\nTo prove the concept and provide immediate value, an indie developer can build this MVP within a single focused day:\n\n1.  <strong>Single Cloud Provider Focus (e.g., AWS):</strong> Start by integrating exclusively with AWS Cost Explorer API for a specific service like EC2 or S3.\n\n2.  <strong>Web-Based Setup Form:</strong> A single static HTML page with JavaScript, hosted on a cheap CDN (e.g., Cloudflare Pages, Netlify) or S3. This form will allow a user to securely input their AWS credentials (or, ideally, an IAM Role ARN for enhanced security) and their alert email address.\n\n3.  <strong>Serverless Backend (e.g., AWS Lambda/GCP Cloud Function/Azure Function):</strong>\n    *   An API endpoint receives the user's setup data from the form.\n    *   <strong>Daily Scheduled Trigger:</strong> A recurring cron job (e.g., CloudWatch Event Rule for Lambda) executes the monitoring function once a day.\n    *   <strong>Cost Data Fetching:</strong> The function queries the AWS Cost Explorer API to retrieve the daily cost for a <em>single, predefined metric</em> (e.g., 'EC2 running hours' total cost) over the last 7 days.\n    *   <strong>Simple Anomaly Detection:</strong> Implement a statistical rule: If today's cost for the monitored metric is more than <em>twice the 7-day moving average</em> for that metric, AND exceeds a minimal absolute threshold (e.g., $10) to filter out negligible fluctuations, trigger an alert.\n    *   <strong>Email Alerting:</strong> Send a simple, plain-text email notification (e.g., via SendGrid API or direct SMTP) to the user's configured email address, detailing the detected anomaly.\n\n4.  <strong>No Dashboard/User Accounts (Initial MVP):</strong> The MVP focuses solely on automated anomaly detection and email alerts. User state management, dashboards, or complex settings are deferred to future iterations. The initial setup is a one-time configuration via the simple form, triggering the serverless function that holds minimal config (alert email, target credentials) securely.\n\nThis focused MVP delivers core value quickly, allowing for rapid iteration based on early user feedback and demonstrating immediate utility.</h1>]]></content:encoded>
