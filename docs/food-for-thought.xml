<p>Indie developers, gather 'round. This year's idea merges AI's power with the timeless simplicity of plain text, wrapped in a conversational interaction paradigm.</p>
<p>Forget complex graph visualizations or rigid folder structures. Imagine talking to your notes. Asking them questions. Getting answers, insights, and connections derived directly from the plain text you've accumulated over years.</p>
<p>This isn't just a query tool; it's a new way to engage with your second brain.</p>
<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>A personal knowledge management system built entirely on local, plain text files (Markdown, TXT), where the primary user interface is a natural language chat interface. You interact with your entire corpus of notes by asking questions, requesting summaries, or prompting for ideas, and an AI backend processes your files to provide intelligent responses.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Unlock the latent value in your personal archives. Gain effortless access to information and discover unexpected connections within your notes using intuitive natural language queries, all while retaining complete ownership and control over your data in future-proof plain text formats.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>Anyone who keeps significant notes, journals, research snippets, or ideas in plain text format: writers, researchers, students, academics, software developers, knowledge workers, and lifelong learners weary of proprietary note-taking apps.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope: Implementable in a Day</h3>
<p>Focus <em>entirely</em> on the core loop: Plain Text -&gt; AI -&gt; Conversation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Directory Selection:</strong> A simple UI allowing the user to select a local directory containing their plain text files.</li>
<li><strong>Text Loading:</strong> Upon selection, read <em>all</em> text content from <code>*.txt</code> or <code>*.md</code> files in that directory into memory.</li>
<li><strong>Chat Interface:</strong> A minimal UI with a text input field for the user's query and a display area for the AI's response.</li>
<li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> When the user submits a query, send the query <em>plus</em> the loaded plain text content (or as much as fits the context window, perhaps split into chunks or summarized) to a large language model API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) via a single API call. Prompt the AI to answer the user's question <em>strictly based on the provided text content</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Display Response:</strong> Render the AI's text response in the display area.</li>
</ol>
<p>The "new HCI" <em>is</em> this conversational interaction over your private text corpus. The "AI" is the LLM interpreting text and query. The "Plain Text" is the durable data store. The MVP avoids complex features like saving chat history, rich text formatting, sophisticated linking, or graphical representations. It's a single interaction loop: Ask -&gt; Get Answer (from your text via AI).</p>
<p>Build this core loop. The profound implications follow.</p>]]></content:encoded>
