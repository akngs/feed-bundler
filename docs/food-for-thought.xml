<p>Imagine a world where conscious living and animal advocacy are integrated into our daily routines, not as a daunting task, but as a journey of personal growth. "Sentient Choices AI" is an AI-powered digital companion designed to foster deeper empathy and understanding for animals among individuals. It guides users towards more mindful decision-making by providing daily prompts, reflections, and educational insights that bridge the gap between human actions and animal well-being, promoting a lifestyle aligned with animal rights and ethical consumption.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core value proposition</h3>
<p>Empower users to cultivate conscious, compassionate choices, reducing their negative impact on animals and the environment, through personalized, AI-guided self-reflection and actionable insights. This tool transforms abstract ethical principles into tangible, daily habits, making animal rights accessible and integrated into personal growth and self-improvement journeys.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target customers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Individuals exploring or committed to vegan/vegetarian lifestyles, seeking motivation and deeper understanding.</li>
<li>Conscious consumers and ethical shoppers aiming to make more informed decisions regarding food, clothing, entertainment, and everyday products.</li>
<li>Pet owners interested in a deeper, more empathetic understanding of their animal companions and their needs.</li>
<li>Anyone interested in personal growth, self-help, and developing a more compassionate outlook on the world and its inhabitants.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most crucial aspect is to launch <em>something</em> that delivers core value quickly. Your MVP should be a web-based chat interface or a simple, single-screen web application:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Daily Ethical Dilemma Prompt:</strong> The application presents a single, text-based ethical scenario each day. This can be pre-loaded from a simple JSON file. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"You're grocery shopping, choosing between conventionally produced eggs and a plant-based scramble. What's your immediate thought process?"</li>
<li>"A friend suggests visiting a zoo on your day off. How do you respond and why?"</li>
<li>"You're craving a burger. You see both a traditional meat option and an innovative plant-based alternative. Which do you lean towards and what factors are influencing you?"</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic Keyword-Triggered Reflection/Education:</strong> After the user types their response to the prompt, a <em>minimal</em> "AI" (initially a simple keyword matcher or regex) scans their input for predefined terms (e.g., "taste," "animal welfare," "cost," "convenience," "environment," "health"). Based on a detected keyword, it displays <em>one</em> relevant, pre-written reflective question or a concise educational snippet from a small, static database. This avoids complex NLP for the MVP. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If "taste" is detected: "The journey for our palate often comes at a cost for others. What's one new plant-based dish you'd be open to trying this week?"</li>
<li>If "animal welfare" is detected: "True welfare extends beyond basic needs. What aspect of animal sentience resonates most with you?"</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple Commitment/Affirmation Button:</strong> Conclude the interaction by asking the user a very simple "Will you consider [ethical action/alternative related to today's prompt] today?" Provide a "Yes / No / Maybe" button purely for user engagement, without storing complex state or analytics. This reinforces the self-help aspect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content Management (Static JSON):</strong> All prompts, keyword-response mappings, and educational snippets are stored in a client-side (or simple server-side) JSON file. The 'AI' logic is effectively a lookup table. No external AI APIs are needed for this initial version. Focus on carefully curated content to provide perceived intelligence.</p></li>
