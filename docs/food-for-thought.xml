            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LoreForge AI is an interactive, AI-powered platform designed for indie game developers and lore enthusiasts to collaboratively build and expand their game worlds. It acts as a living wiki for your game's narrative, characters, and settings, with artificial intelligence serving as your tireless co-author and lore-master.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Break through creative blocks, maintain narrative consistency across vast game universes, and empower your community to contribute to the lore's evolution. LoreForge AI accelerates world-building, ensures coherence, and deepens player immersion by making lore creation a collaborative, AI-assisted journey.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>Solo indie game developers, small game studios focused on narrative or RPGs, dungeon masters for tabletop RPGs, and dedicated player communities eager to engage with and contribute to their favorite game's backstory.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>To truly demonstrate the core AI-assisted lore generation, the MVP focuses on a single-page interactive demo:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The AI Story Seed:</strong> A single webpage displaying a large, editable text area pre-populated with a simple game lore fragment (e.g., 'The ancient city of Aerthos, once a bustling hub, now lies in ruin, shrouded in an eternal mist. Only whispers remain of the forgotten sorcerer who cursed it.').</p></li>
<li><p><strong>'AI Lore Expansion' Button:</strong> A prominent button below the text area.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual AI Prompting:</strong> When the button is clicked, the current content of the text area is sent to a large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4, Claude, Gemini). The prompt should instruct the AI to suggest 3-5 concise, creative ways to expand on the <em>existing</em> lore, such as adding details about characters, locations, events, or mysteries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive AI Output:</strong> The AI's suggestions are displayed clearly below the button (e.g., as bullet points). Each suggestion should have a small 'Add to Lore' button next to it, allowing the user to append that suggestion to the main text area with a single click.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No User Accounts/Persistence:</strong> The data is temporary and resets on page refresh. The goal is to quickly showcase the powerful iterative AI-assisted lore generation, not to build a full wiki backend yet. This stripped-down approach makes it genuinely achievable within a single day for an experienced indie developer.</p></li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>
