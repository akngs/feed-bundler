            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indie developers, listen up. We build, we iterate, we often leave behind breadcrumbs – or worse, entire abandoned campsites – in our code. Commented-out sections, old attempts, debugging prints left behind. This clutter isn't just aesthetic; it's a silent killer of readability, a breeding ground for technical debt, and a constant drain on your cognitive load. What if you had an always-on, non-judgmental partner whose sole mission was to keep your codebase pristine, identifying and flagging the digital debris before it ever accumulates?</p>
<h3 id="brief-description-of-the-idea">Brief Description of the Idea</h3>
<p>Introducing the 'Dead Code Janitor Bot,' an autonomous AI-powered agent designed to meticulously scan your codebase as you write, specifically targeting commonly commented-out or 'dead' code snippets. Its purpose is to proactively suggest their removal, ensuring your project remains lean, clean, and focused.</p>
<h3 id="core-value-proposition">Core Value Proposition</h3>
<p>The Janitor Bot liberates you from accumulated code clutter, significantly reduces cognitive load during development, and acts as your vigilant, automated cleaner. By catching these issues early and offering simple removal options, it prevents the creeping accumulation of technical debt and eliminates the need for frustrating 'code archaeology' where you waste precious time deciphering obsolete relics.</p>
<h3 id="target-customers">Target Customers</h3>
<p>This tool is perfect for solo developers, small indie studios, open-source project contributors, and anyone who has ever found themselves saying, 'I'll remove that later' or 'I need this commented out just in case,' only to forget about it entirely.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp-scope-implementable-in-a-day">Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope (Implementable in a Day)</h3>
<p>To get this agent into your hands within a single day, the MVP will focus on a hyper-specific, high-impact problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> A VS Code Extension (due to its widespread adoption and accessible API).</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> The agent will perform its check automatically whenever you save a file (<code>textDocument/didSave</code>). This ensures continuous, low-friction scanning.</li>
<li><strong>Core Logic (The 'AI' Hint):</strong> The initial intelligence will be a finely-tuned regular expression or a simple heuristic. It will specifically target multi-line blocks of code that are entirely commented out (e.g., using <code>//</code> on multiple consecutive lines, or <code>/* ... */</code> block comments) and likely represent old, unused code. The 'AI' aspect lies in its attempt to distinguish these from genuine, descriptive comments.</li>
<li><strong>User Interface:</strong> When potential dead code is detected, a 'Diagnostic' (a subtle warning or info message) will appear directly on the relevant lines in your editor and also in the 'Problems' panel. The message will be concise: 'Potential dead code: Consider removing this commented-out block.'</li>
<li><strong>Actionability:</strong> No automatic deletion. Instead, a convenient 'Quick Fix' option (the familiar lightbulb icon) will appear. Clicking it will offer 'Remove Dead Code Block,' which will simply delete the identified lines, empowering the developer to act when ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>This MVP is lean, delivers immediate value by tackling a pervasive development habit, and lays the groundwork for more sophisticated autonomous code hygiene agents.</p>]]></content:encoded>
